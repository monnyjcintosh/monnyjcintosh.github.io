<h1 id="philosophy-of-cognitive-science">Philosophy of Cognitive Science</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for eight tutorials in Philosophy of Cognitive Science. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="general-information">GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Before writing your essay, you should read <strong>all</strong> of the Core Reading for the topic unless otherwise indicated. Your essay and tutorial is only a first step towards an understanding of a topic, however. For finals, you will need to be able to answer any question that is set on around five topics, and you should use the Further Reading suggestions, in conjunction with the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/125_Philosophy_of_Cognitive_Science_Jan11.pdf">Faculty Reading list</a>, in vacations to work on the topics that most interest you.</p>

<p>Plan your essay out <strong>before</strong> you do any reading. That might seem back to front: you haven’t done any reading, so how can you plan out what you’ve got to say? But as soon as you know what the essay question is, you can form some idea of the questions you need to be thinking about, and these will structure both your essay, at least in a preliminary way, and your reading. You can, and most likely will, revise your essay plan as you do the reading.</p>

<p>In addition to an essay, you should also be compiling notes, stating the main positions or puzzles relating to the week’s topic, with bullet points summarising their pros and cons. You should revise and supplement these notes after the tutorial and as you read and attend lectures on the subject over the rest of your time in Oxford. They are much more important than your essay. Your essay is a snapshot of your understanding of the topic at a particular time, taken from the particular angle determined by the essay question. In your exams, your answers will be snapshots of a much deeper understanding taken from a different angle - they will be answers to different questions! Your notes should be improving with your understanding.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="course-plan">COURSE PLAN</h2>
<p>The first four tutorials are intended to introduce students to the classical computational theory of mind, taking a very brisk historical route to it via Chomsky’s pioneering work in linguistics and Marr’s in vision science, before looking at one of its main rivals, connectionism, and some possible limitations of the view in weeks five and six. Topics for the remaining two tutorials will be decided in consultation with students. Options here include, but are not limited to, those specified in the Further Topics. Have a look at past papers and the Faculty Reading list to see what interests you.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Stich (1978) draws attention to another useful distinction in thinking about cognitive science, discussed by Drayson, between beliefs and what he calls <em>subdoxastic</em> states. For Dennett’s later views, discussed by Hornsby, see, in the first instance, his (1981). Davies (2000) is another discussion of the personal/subpersonal distinction, and Bennett and Hacker (2003) a recent example of the objection to which Dennett was responding in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
George (1986) is a short, useful clarification of what’s at stake between Quine and Chomsky. Davies (1987) defends and elaborates Evans’ attempt to meet Quine’s challenge. George (1989) is an edited volume. The contributions from George, Peacocke, and Davies are all relevant. Collins (2007) argues that linguistic competence should not be understood in terms of knowledge, tacit or otherwise, at all. <!--Davies (2015) is a useful introductory survey piece.--></p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Peacocke (1986) argues for the need for a fourth level of explanation, intermediate between Marr’s computational and algorithmic levels. Feest (2003) discusses the relation between multiple realizability and the autonomy of psychological explanation. Bechtel and Wright (2009) consider the extent to which the mechanistic perspective provides a unified account of psychological explanation. Weiskopf (2011) defends the view that psychological explanation need not be mechanistic.</p>

Laurence and Margolis (1997) address the objection that the LOTH involves a vicious regress. Matthews (2007) argues against the RTM/CTM more generally, which he calls the Received View.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Are the reasons for thinking that it is legitimate to appeal to internal representations in psychology identical to the reasons for believing that there is a language of thought?</p>

<p>What is the language of thought hypothesis committed to, over and above realism about propositional attitude states? What grounds, if any, are there for this further commitment?</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
‘Connectionist models of cognitive processes are either unable to account for the systematicity of cognitive processes or are merely implementations of classical architectures. Either way, it follows that the mind cannot be a connectionist network.’ Explain and assess this objection.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Calvo and Symons (2014) is a recent edited volume devoted to the systematicity challenge. See in particular the essays in Part I. Churchland (1998) concerns a different issue, defending an account of content in connectionist networks based on similarities and differences between activation patterns. Fodor and Lepore (1999) is a reply. Garson (1997/2015) is an introductory survey of these and other issues raised by connectionism.</p>

The whole of Fodor (1983) is essential reading for this topic if you are pursuing it in any depth. Samuels (2012) is an excellent survey piece on arguments for and against <em>massive modularity</em> (a possible further topic). Fuller and Samuels (2014) is focused on Fodor’s claim that scientific inference is holistic. Jenkin and Siegel (2015) is a short survey of work on an issue relevant to Fodor’s claim that input systems are modular, whether perception is cognitively penetrable.</p>

the possibility of free action?

Does having a conscious sense of free will matter for whether or not someone is responsible for his or her actions?

Critically discuss the following claim: ‘What we normally describe as the delusional belief that P ought sometimes to be described as the delusional belief that I believe that P.’ (CURRIE)

Are there good reasons for thinking that delusions are so irrational that they could not be a type of belief? If they are not beliefs, what are they?

## 3. MARR'S THEORY
Marr's 3 levels: what and why; how it's done; how it's implemented. Do we need all three? (Radical neuron doctrines) Do we need a fourth? Are the levels independent? What's going on at the algorithmic level?

In what sense, if any, can we study the mind/brain independently at each of Marr’s three levels of analysis and in what sense, if any, do the three levels constrain each other?

'Each of the three levels of description will have its place in the eventual understanding of perceptual information processing, and of course they are logically and causally related.' (MARR) 'In Marr’s view, a higher level was independent of the levels below it.' (CHURCHLAND & SEJNOWSKI) Explain and discuss.

## 1. THE COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF MIND
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is the Computational Theory of Mind (CTM)? What is the source of its appeal? Is it correct?

**FURTHER READING**  
Putnam is one of the original proponents of the CTM, but he later came to reject it, raising much the same problem as that raised by Searle in his (1988). (It is quite tough going though.) The problem raises the question, what exactly is computation? Piccinini (2010/15) is an introductory article on the issue, written by a leading proponent of a *mechanistic* view. For two of the leading alternatives to the mechanistic view, the *semantic* and *causal* views, see Sprevak (2010) and Chalmers (2011) respectively.

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
What does it mean to say that 'the mind is the software of the brain'? (BLOCK) Is this the best way to understand the relation between a psychological explanation of human behaviour and empirical discoveries in cognitive neuroscience?

'Psychology without homunculi is impossible. But psychology with homunculi is doomed to circularity or infinite regress, so psychology is impossible.' Dennett says that this problem has 'bedeviled philosophers and psychologists for over two hundred years'. What exactly is the problem and how, if at all, does information-processing psychology avoid it?
