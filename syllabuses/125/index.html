<h1 id="philosophy-of-cognitive-science">Philosophy of Cognitive Science</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Cognitive Science. Many of the readings are online, and all can be obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything. </p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/125_Philosophy_of_Cognitive_Science_Jan11.pdf">Faculty Reading list</a>.  </p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the following <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. We begin by looking at meta-theoretical issues raised by two classics of cognitive science, Chomsky’s work in linguistics and Marr’s work on vision. We then move on to look at the classical computational theory of mind, as articulated by one of its leading proponents, Jerry Fodor. We then look at one of the main alternatives to the classical account, connectionism, and an area that has been thought by some to lie beyond the reach of cognitive science, consciousness. Only the first six weeks are fixed, leaving us two other weeks to pursue topics of your choosing. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. (I’ve also listed some <strong>SPECIAL TOPICS</strong>, which some students have wanted to explore in the past. These are less likely to come up in exams, and some presuppose familiarity with other topics, but will help to deepen your understanding.) </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Chomsky’s work in linguistics was a major part of the cognitive revolution of the 1950s. Chomsky (1965) presents some of his main conceptual innovations, including the notion of tacit knowledge. George (1986) is a short, and extremely useful discussion of the Quine-Chomsky debate. Evans’ dispositional approach was developed by Martin Davies and Christopher Peacocke, and criticised by Crispin Wright. For references and discussion, see their contributions to George (1989). (The contributions from George and Putnam are also relevant to this week’s topic.) Miller (1997) is a useful review of the debate, and there is some critical discussion of the dispositional approach in Collins (2004), who argues Chomsky’s notion of tacit knowledge is not epistemological in any substantive sense.  </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Peacocke (1986) argues for the need for a fourth level, intermediate between Marr’s computational and algorithmic-representational levels. See also the commentaries on this, and Peacocke’s replies, in <em>Mind &amp; Language</em> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14680017/1/4">Volume 1, Issue 4</a>. Sterelny (1990) is introductory, discussing problems in determining the algorithmic-representational level and the distinction between psychology and neuroscience. For more on the latter issue, see Gold and Stoljar (1999), which is published alongside various peer commentaries, and Feest (2003). Bechtel and Shagrir (2015), part of a special issue of <em>Topics in Cognitive Science</em> marking the 30th anniversary of Marr’s <em>Vision</em>, defends the importance of Marr’s three levels to understanding information-processing devices.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Aydede (1998/2010), an introductory overview of the LOTH, its relation to the CTM, and arguments for and against it, is a good first port of call for further work on this issue. The LOTH is typically advanced as an empirical thesis, but Rey (1995) offers a more or less <em>a priori</em> line of argument. Laurence and Margolis (1997) examine regress arguments against the LOTH (though be warned that their take on Fodor is a bit misleading). Camp (2007) argues against the claim that thought must be language-like. This is a particularly helpful piece if you want to get clearer on the relationship between the CTM and the LOTH. Matthews (2007) argues against the RTM/CTM more generally.  </p>

Fodor (1983) is the book in which he first introduced his views on modularity, and is essential reading for this topic. Part III argues input systems are modular. Part IV argues central systems are not, and so are computationally intractable. Chapters 2 and 3 of Fodor (2000), listed above, update the case for thinking that central systems are computationally intractable. For replies, see Ludwig and Schneider (2008) and Fuller and Samuels (2014). Shea (2014) looks at the distinction between top-down and bottom-up effects, often invoked in discussions of modularity. Stokes and Bergeron (2015) look at the implications of the alleged cognitive penetrability of perception.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Matthews (1997) argues that neither connectionists nor classicists have an explanation of systematicity, but that there are grounds for optimism about the prospects for a connectionist account. Johnson (2004) argues that thought is not systematic, properly understood, so there is nothing here for the connectionist to explain anyway. McLaughlin (2009) responds to both Johnson and Robert Cummins, from whom Johnson took his cue. Calvo and Symons (2014) is a recent volume on the systematicity debate. Garson (1997/2015) is a survey, summarising the systematicity debate and many other issues. </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
The use of double dissociations in theorising about cognition goes back to the 19th century, and Paul Broca, who identified a region of the brain employed in language processing, though the term <em>double dissociation</em> was first introduced by Hans-Lukas Tueber (1955). Coltheart (1999) is a short, clear statement of one of the key components of his ultra-cognitivist approach, the idea that the mind is composed of a system of domain-specific modules. Juola and Plunkett (2000) is an influential criticism of double dissociation methodology. McGeer (2007) argues on both empirical and philosophical grounds that the ultra-cognitivist approach is fundamentally misguided. Van Orden et al. (2010) argue that double dissociation of reading modules illustrates general problems with the ultra-cognitivists’ assumption of modularity. </p>

Harman (2010) discusses potential misunderstandings of reports on fMRI research. Machery (2012) compares forward or “function-to-structure” inferences to the inferences based on dissociations in cognitive neuropsychology, and argues that the former are in poorer epistemic standing, while his (2014) paper defends reverse inference.</p>

Two SEP entries should be your first port of call in doing further work on this topic: Barlassina and Gordon (1997/2017) and Ravenscroft (1997/2016), the first on simulation theories and the second on theory theories. These have both been recently updated, and are good guides to the literature. Gallese and Goldman (1998) suggest that simulation theory gains support from the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys. Saxe (2005) assesses this in the context of the argument from error, and finds it wanting. Short and Riggs (2016) respond to Saxe, defending the simulation theory.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
For discussion of the implications of “acquired sociopathy” for <em>motivational internalism</em>, the meta-ethical view that moral judgements are intrinsically motivating, see Nichols (2002), Roskies (2003) and Maibom (2005). Sinnott-Armstrong (2008) contains specially commissioned essays and responses on the implications of neuroscience for morality. See especially the essays by Greene, Kiehl, and Joyce.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Is there good reason to think that we have more than one cognitive system for making moral judgments? What would this show about morality? (2014)</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the massive modularity thesis? How, if at all, do the notions of modularity employed by its proponents differ from Fodor’s? What are the best arguments for it?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Barrett and Kurzban (2006) is a useful review of arguments for and against massive modularity. (They are proponents.) Peter Carruthers defends massive modularity at length, in his (2006) book. Wilson (2008) is a contribution to a symposium on this published by <em>Mind &amp; Language</em>. Among other things, Wilson discusses the so-called argument from animals. Rabaglia et al. (2011) present a challenge for massive modularity based on the so-called <em>positive manifold</em>, the fact that individuals who are high scoring in one cognitive domain tend to be high scoring on other cognitive domains. This suggests that high-level cognitive capacties are subserved by a single domain-general mechanism, rather than a range of domain-specific ones, as proponents of massive modularity claim. Robbins (2013) reviews the empirical evidence for massive modularity, and finds it wanting. </p>
