<h1 id="philosophy-of-mind">Philosophy of Mind</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Mind. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/104%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind%20Oct%2010.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. The focus is on the main contemporary positions on the mind-body problem, looking at related issues concerning consciousness and causation. The last two weeks have been left open for topics of your choice. Options here include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. I’ve also included some <strong>SPECIAL TOPICS</strong>, which are less likely to come up in exams, and may presuppose familiarity with other topics, but will help to deepen your understanding.</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Philosophy of Mind to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of this reading list at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>Papineau (2002) presents a causal argument for the type-identity theory, connecting with issues you can look at concerning <a href="#mental_causation"><strong>MENTAL CAUSATION</strong></a>. Most of the other readings are focused on the multiple realizability argument against the theory. Lewis (1980) offers a response to the argument, as does Bechtel and Mundale (1999)—a particularly nice paper if you’re interested in relevant empirical work. Fodor (1997) is a defence of the argument, written by one of its original proponents. Bickle’s (1998/2013) entry for the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia</em> provides a useful overview, and Polger and Shapiro (2016) is a recent book-length treatment of the topic. Lewis (1995) discusses a range of issues, including multiple realizability, and provides a useful summary of his views in the philosophy of mind.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>Other essential papers by Davidson on this topic include his (1974) and (1995). And you’ll find much of interest besides Kim’s paper in Part III of Ernie Lepore and Brian McLaughlin, eds. (1985) <i>Actions and Events: Perspectives on the Philosophy of Donald Davidson</i> (Blackwell). Particularly recommended are McLaughlin’s introduction, and the papers by Horgan and Tye, Hornsby, Johnston, and McDowell. McDowell’s paper is particularly important if you’re thinking about what the argument for the anomalousness of the mental might be. On that issue, see also Tiffany (2001), which critically discusses Kim, McDowell, and Child. For Davidson’s response to the charge of epiphenomenalism, see his contribution, ‘Thinking Causes’, to Heil and Mele, eds. (1993). The other papers in Part I of this volume are replies to Davidson, and are well worth reading, particularly Kim’s. For more recent work on the issue, try Heil (2009). Also of relevance here is an issue of interpretation. The standard take on Davidson’s anomalous monism is that it’s a form of non-reductive physicalism. In a series of papers, Frederick Stoutland has argued that this is a mistake, and that it’s ontologically neutral, more akin to the sort of view that can be found in Spinoza. See, for example, Stoutland (2011). For another introductory discussion of anomalous monism, see Ch. 8 of the book by Marc Joseph listed in last week’s Further Reading. Yalowitz (2005/12) is perhaps a bit too advanced to count as introductory, but it is a useful survey and a good source for further references.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Very crudely, Kripke’s challenge revolves around two claims, first, that the relevant identities—e.g. that pain is the firing of c-fibres—are false if it is possible for them to be false, and second, that it <em>is</em> possible for them to be false. The first claim is widely accepted, though see Lewis (1980) and (1995), listed in the Further Reading for <a href="#type-identity"><strong>TYPE-IDENTITY THEORIES</strong></a> for a dissenting voice. Most of the discussion focuses on the second claim, and in particular whether or not the fact that we can, in some sense, imagine or conceive of the relevant identities being false gives us a good reason to think that it is possible for them to be false. Yablo (1993) is a classic discussion of the connection between conceivability and possibility. See also Gendler and Hawthorne, eds. (2004), especially the extremely useful editors’ introduction—§3 of which offers a nice introduction to Kripke’s argument and some of the technical concepts that figure in it—and the papers by Bealer, Chalmers, Wright, and Yablo. And see Byrne (2007) for argument to the effect that the focus on conceivability and imaginability is misplaced. Though his challenge is primarily directed against the type-identity theory, Kripke thinks it also tells against token-identity theories, such as <a href="#anomalous_monism"><strong>ANOMALOUS MONISM</strong></a>. McGinn (1977) is a short piece arguing that this is a mistake. Hughes (2004) discusses both versions of the challenge in detail, and is strongly recommended. Indeed, if you’re going to read just one other thing on Kripke’s challenge, read this. See also Shoemaker (1994) for discussion of how it might be thought to tell against <a href="#functionalism"><strong>FUNCTIONALISM</strong></a>—although this is best left until after you’ve done some work on that topic. Bealer (1994) defends a version of Kripke’s modal argument, arguing that it favourably compares with the multiple realizability argument, the certainty argument (also known as the argument from doubt), and <strong>THE KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENT</strong>, and that, suitably adapted, it goes through. Contemporary discussion often focuses on a similar modal argument defended by David Chalmers. If you are working on Kripke’s challenge for finals, it is a good idea to familiarise yourself with this. See the entry for <strong>ZOMBIES</strong>.</p>

From Chalmers:


Chalmers (chapter 27) gives a related modal argument against materialism, supplemented by an analysis using two-dimensional semantics. Jackson (chapter 21) discusses some closely related issues involving modality and materialism. Levine (chapter 35) addresses Kripke's argument, while Loar (chapter 30) addresses modal arguments in a manner broadly compatible with Hill's approach. In the literature, modal arguments involving zombies are put forward by Campbell (1970) and Kirk (1974) and are developed by Chalmers (1996). Chalmers (1999) responds to Hill's and Loar's analyses. Gendler and Hawthorne (2002) contains a number of recent papers discussing modal arguments. Maxwell's view is grounded in some ideas of Russell (1927), which are developed in more depth by Lockwood (1989), and criticized by Foster (1991).

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) Is the intuition that there is an element of contingency in the relation between pain and C-fibre stimulation any more reliable as a guide to what is really possible than the intuition that there is an element of contingency in the relation between heat and molecular motion?<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration:line-through">(b) What accounts for the subjectivity of pain?</span> (2016)</p>

<p>Is the statement ‘pain state = brain state’ necessary and a posteriori? What, if anything, does this tell us about the identification of the mental and the physical? (2011)</p>

<p>‘The correspondence between a brain state and a mental state seems to have a certain obvious element of contingency…. [Ildentity is not a relation which can hold contingently between objects. Therefore, if the identity thesis were correct, the element of contingency would not lie in the relation between the mental and physical states.’ (KRIPKE) Discuss. (2010)</p>

<p>Kim responds to Block in his (2005). For critical discussion of Jackson and Pettit’s program model, see Menzies (2007). For critical discussion of Yablo’s account of mental causation, see Funkhouser (2006). For some alternative responses to the exclusion problem, see Bennett (2003), Gibbons (2006), and Árnadóttir and Crane (2013)—the last a nice, relatively recent paper, arguing that the exclusion principle can be rejected without appeal to any heavy-duty assumptions about the metaphysics of causation. Robb and Heil’s (2003/18) entry for the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia</em> is a survey piece discussing the exclusion problem and various other problems concerning mental causation.

<p>Pessin and Goldberg, eds. (1996) is an invaluable collection, containing all the Core Readings and much more besides. Especially recommended are Putnam’s ‘The Meaning of “Meaning”’, which kick-started the whole debate, the papers by Loar, Fodor, Jackson and Pettit, and Stalnaker in Part III, and the papers by Davidson and Burge in Part IV. Beyond these, you’ll want to think about recent internalist developments, especially Chalmers’ <em>two dimensionalism</em> (building on Loar’s approach) and Segal’s <em>radical internalism</em>. For the former, see Chalmers’ paper ‘The Components of Content (Revised Version)’ in <strong>Chalmers</strong>, and the critical discussion in Byrne and Pryor (2006). For the latter, see Segal’s (2004), as well as his debate with Sarah Sawyer in McLaughlin and Cohen, eds. (2007). You’ll also want to think about how externalists might respond to worries about mental causation. Yablo (2003) is recommended, as is the work of Fred Dretske, which you might look at in connection with <a href="#action"><strong>ACTIONS, REASONS, and CAUSES</strong></a>. Lastly, you’ll want to think about whether externalism is compatible with privileged access. Ludlow and Martin, eds. (1998) is useful here, containing various classic papers, including both Burge (1979) and McKinsey (1991). See especially Paul Boghossian’s ‘Content and Self-Knowledge’, presenting the so-called <em>slow switching</em> argument for incompatibilism. See also the debate between Brueckner and McKinsey in McLaughlin and Cohen, eds. (2007), and Parent (2013/17), a useful survey article on the issue.</p>

<p>The following topics come up fairly regularly in past papers, and I recommend that, in selecting topics for the last two weeks of term, you choose at least one from these. To help you get a rough sense of what is involved, I have provided past paper questions for each topic, but I have not yet got round to settling on essay questions and reading for the majority of them, and even where I have, I may want to make some revisions. Consequently, let me as soon as possible if you want to study any of them, so as to give me time to make any necessary changes.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-6">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>If you are pursuing this topic in more depth, the rest of the essays in the first part of Davidson’s (2001) collection are essential reading. You’ll also want to think more about the debate between causalists like Davidson and non-causalists like Wilson. Sehon, a leading non-causalist, usefully summarises the issues in his (2010). McLaughlin (2013) is a recent contribution to the debate. Thompson (2008) offers a radically different approach, on which actions are understood on a part-whole model. Hornsby (1993) offers a distinctive take on the sorts of issues raised by Dretske, which you will also look in connection with <a href="#anomalous_monism"><strong>ANOMALOUS MONISM</strong></a>. Alvarez (2010) is a nuanced discussion of different sorts of reasons, bearing among other things on Dancy’s position. Stout (2005) is a great book on all sorts of issues in the philosophy of action. See especially Ch. 5, though you’ll find much of relevance in the rest too. See also Joseph (2004), an introduction to Davidson’s philosophy for undergraduates.</p>

<p>‘The challenge is not just to come to understand our concept of the mental, but to further understand our concept of the physical.’ Discuss. (2013)</p>

<p>What is it that distinguishes physicalists from those who reject physicalism? (2011)</p>

<p>‘The phenomenon of self-deception seems paradoxical only if we assume that people are perfectly rational and perfectly self-aware. But that assumption is obviously false. So there is really no difficulty in making sense of self-deception.’ Discuss. (2016)</p>

<p>‘The very idea of self-deception is a contradiction.’<br />
‘The capacity for self-deception is an entrenched feature of human nature.’<br />
Can these two statements be reconciled? (2013)</p>

<p>Is self-deception appropriately so-called? (2012)</p>

<p>Could there be self-deception without selves? (2011)</p>
