<h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Ethics. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/103%20Ethics%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the following <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. Only the first six weeks are fixed, leaving us two weeks to pursue topics in meta-ethics of your choosing.</p>

<p><strong>ANTHOLOGIES and TEXTBOOKS</strong></p>

<p>There are no set texts for this paper, but we will mainly be focusing on early modern debates, particularly Hume and Kant. The key works are Hume’s <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em> (1738/1740) and <em>An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals</em> (1751) and Kant’s <em>Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals</em> (1785). I recommend the Oxford Philosophical Texts editions of these, though most other scholarly editions will do just as well. The order and choice of topics is loosely based on David Wiggins’ excellent <em>Ethics: Twelve Lectures on the Philosophy of Morality</em> (Penguin, 2006). Chapters of this are suggested in connection with certain topics below, and it will also be helpful to read it all when you look back over the material at the end of term. For more introductory discussion of many of the topics we’ll cover — and more besides — try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marcia Baron, Philip Pettit, and Michael Slote (1997) <em>Three Methods of Ethics</em> (Blackwell)  </li>
  <li>Stephen Darwall (1998) <em>Philosophical Ethics</em> (Westview Press)</li>
  <li>John Deigh (2010) <em>An Introduction to Ethics</em> (CUP)  </li>
  <li>Richard Norman (1998) <em>The Moral Philosophers</em>, 2nd edition (OUP)</li>
  <li>James Rachels (2002) <em>The Elements of Moral Philosophy</em>, 4th ed. (McGraw-Hill)</li>
  <li>Russ Shafer-Landau (2014) <em>The Fundamentals of Ethics</em>, 3rd ed. (OUP)  </li>
  <li>Bernard Williams (1972) <em>Morality: An Introduction to Ethics</em> (CUP)</li>
</ul>

<!--

You'll generally find the other early modern pieces you need in one or the other of the following anthologies, which I refer to below as **Raphael** and **Schneewind** respectively:

- D\. D. Raphael, ed. (1969) *British Moralists, 1650-1800, Vol. I and II* (OUP)  
- J. B. Schneewind, ed. (2003) *Moral Philosophy from Montaigne to Kant* (CUP)

The order and choice of topics is loosely based on David Wiggins' excellent *Ethics: Twelve Lectures on the Philosophy of Morality* (Penguin, 2006). Chapters of this are suggested in connection with certain topics below, and it will also be helpful to read it all when you look back over the material at the end of term. For two books more focused on the history of early modern moral philosophy, especially useful for looking back over the material of the first five weeks of term, try Stephen Darwall's *The British Moralists and the Internal 'Ought' 1640-1740* (OUP, 1995) and Jerome Schneewind's *The Invention of Autonomy* (CUP, 1998).

How much turns on the possibility of persuading the amoralist to be moral? (2016)  </p>

<p>‘[I]n all ingenuous natures, the antipathy to treachery and roguery is too strong to be counter-balanced by any views of profit or pecuniary advantage. Inward peace of mind, consciousness of integrity, a satisfactory review of our own conduct; these are circumstances, very requisite to happiness, and will be cherished and cultivated by every honest man, who feels the importance of them.’ (HUME) How good a response is this to the amoralist? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Can Hume’s sentimentalism adequately account for the normativity of moral assessment? (2016)</p>

<p>‘Since morals have an influence on the actions and affections, it follows that they cannot be derived from reason… Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.’ (HUME) Discuss. (2014)</p>

<p>‘Just because reason alone “is not a motive to any action of the will” (HUME), it need not follow that moral attitudes cannot be beliefs.’ Discuss. (2012)</p>

Euthyphro:

1. The responses made from the common POV are defined either in terms of mind-independent evaluative facts (e.g. as responses to the facts) or in terms of mind-dependent, non-evaluative facts (e.g. as the responses of such-and-such agents).
2. If mind-independent, then there are mind-independent evaluative truths.
3. If non-evaluative, then responses are morally arbitrary, lacking in normative authority.
4. So sentimentalism is either self-defeating or false.

Non-reductivism: give up 1., by defining in terms of mind-dependent evaluative facts.
Reductivism: give up 3. - defining in terms of mind-dependent non-evaluative facts is OK.

How to argue for 3.: Shafer-Landau, in (2003) book, points to apparent possibility of, e.g., genocide being endorsed by common POV. (But maybe the possibility is at best only apparent?)

Huemer: if non-evaluative, then there's *no reason* for the response. (But isn't this too strong? Only follows that there's no *moral* reason.)

Better, perhaps -- what lies behind 3. is the Missing Normativity Problem: if non-evaluative, then to say that the common POV approves of X is not to *endorse* X, but a non-normative fact about X's relation to a certain psychology (Johnston/Blackburn). Maybe this is a way of understanding Moore's naturalistic fallacy.

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
‘Acting from duty seems to me to be crucial to morally good conduct.’ (MARCIA BARON) Is it? (2016)</p>

<p>What does Kant mean by the claim that it is impossible to conceive of anything which is good without qualification except a good will? Is he right? (2014)</p>

<p>Is moral worth specially related to the motive of duty? (2013)</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the relationship between subsidiary moral principles (such as prohibitions on lying and suicide) and the “universal law” version of Kant’s categorical imperative? In particular, can the former soundly be derived from the latter? If not, what implications does this have for Kant’s moral philosophy?</p>

## FREE WILL and MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Is a person morally responsible for doing something at a certain time only if she could have done otherwise at that time?

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘The problem of free will has been misrepresented insofar as it has been thought to be a purely metaphysical problem.’ (SUSAN WOLF) Discuss. (2016)

How free does the will need to be? (2015)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Do Mackie’s arguments from queerness and relativity give us good reason not to be moral realists?  If not, are there any other arguments that do?

Blackburn and McDowell's papers were both first published in T. Honderich, ed. *Morality and Objectivity* (Routledge and Kegan Paul).     

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘There is no version of metaethical moral realism that can combine both metaphysical and epistemological plausibility, and so the realist project should be abandoned.’ Discuss. (2016)

‘Metaphysicians have no business telling physicists anything about physical facts. Likewise, metaethics must be neutral with regard to substantive moral claims. Error theory violates this requirement. Hence error theory is false.’ Is this a good argument? (2015)  

‘Murder is wrong. If murder is wrong, then there are moral facts, for example, the fact that murder is wrong. Hence there are moral facts.’ Is this a good argument? (2015)  

How worried should a moral realist be by the fact that there is no science of ethics? (2014)

Does the claim that moral discourse is truth-apt have any bearing on the truth of moral realism? (2013)

‘Anyone who argues against moral realism by appeal to the kinds of explanation proper to moral attitudes is forgetting that there are sociological explanations of scientific discoveries.’ Discuss. (2013)

‘If morality were a fiction, we could not come to know it was and morality still retain its grip on us. So morality is not a fiction.’ Discuss. (2013)

Should we be surprised if convinced moral error theorists continue to care about the difference between moral right and wrong? (2012)
 

 

<!-- 
NON-COGNITIVISM

‘The trouble with non-cognitivism is that only the logic of belief can explain the irrationality of tolerating what one condemns.’ Is that right? (2016)

‘We cannot find any distinctly moral attitudes in ourselves. Hence non-cognitivism cannot make sense of the difference between ethical and other evaluative judgments, and is thus mistaken.’ Discuss. (2015)

Can a non-cognitivist account for the validity of moral arguments? (2014)

MORAL RELATIVISM

Must any plausible moral relativism presuppose non-relativist foundations? If so, is that a problem for relativists? (2016)

Is moral scepticism a good response to moral relativism? (2013)

‘Even the best arguments for moral relativism succeed only in establishing moral scepticism.’ Discuss. (2012)

MOTIVATIONAL INTERNALISM

‘Evil, be thou my good’. Can motivational internalism make sense of this? (2016)

‘It is no more puzzling that beliefs alone can motivate us than that desires alone can – it is merely less common that they do.’ Is that so? (2014)

What does it mean to say that moral attitudes are intrinsically motivating? Is it true? (2013)
 

EXTERNAL REASONS

‘To say that they possessed a reason ... while acknowledging that any justificatory force of this reason is inaccessible to them as reasoning beings is, I think, not only a misuse of language, but undermines the point of discourse about reasons and rationality.’ (GERALD GAUS) Discuss. (2016)
