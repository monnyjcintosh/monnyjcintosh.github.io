<h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Ethics. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/103%20Ethics%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the following <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. We start with a week on the question, <em>Why Be Moral?</em>, raising questions about the content, status, and source of morality that we explore over the rest of the term, beginning with two highlights from the early modern period, the work of Hume and Kant. We then spend two weeks on consequentualism and contractualism, positions in contemporary normative ethics drawing, respectively, on Hume’s and Kant’s work. You can choose topics for the last two weeks. Options include the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve had advice from various friends in putting together this reading list and its previous incarnations, and am particularly grateful to Nadine Elzein, Chris Jay, Ed Lamb, Stefan Sienkiewicz, and Tom Sinclair. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of it at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<p>There are no set textbooks, but the following are all recommended. Driver (2006) and Fisher (2011), focused on normative ethics and metaethics respectively, are more elementary, and best suited for vacation reading beforehand. During term itself, you might find it more useful to consult Timmons (2012) and van Roojen (2015), which discuss the issues in a bit more depth.</p>

<p>The order and choice of topics is loosely based on that of David Wiggins’ excellent book, <em>Ethics: Twelve Lectures on the Philosophy of Morality</em> (Penguin, 2006). Despite being published by Penguin, it’s not a particularly easy read, and is probably best tackled after the end of term, but it is strongly recommended, especially the nine chapters of Part I, <em>Morality: Its motive and content</em>.</p>

<p>Most of the key readings for each topic can be accessed online, but if you want them in print, you’ll find many of them in the following anthologies. I’ll refer to them below as <strong>C&amp;M</strong>, <strong>SL</strong>, and <strong>Sher</strong> respectively. <strong>C&amp;M</strong> is the most comprehensive, but also by far the most expensive. You might be able to pick up earlier editions, containing similar selections, for a better price second-hand.</p>

<p>Lastly, and particularly if you are pursuing either of the first two topics in more depth, you might want to look at works by the likes of Hobbes, Mandeville, Butler, Clarke, Hutcheson, and, of course, Hume. The most important works by these and other British moral philosophers of the early modern period can be found in the following anthology, found in most college libraries.

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>We’ll be returning to issues raised this week throughout the term. Regardless of whether you’re exploring them in more depth, you should have at least a passing acquaintance with the way they are raised in Plato’s <em>Republic</em> by Thrasymachus and, especially, the brothers Glaucon and Adeimantus. If you <em>are</em> exploring them in more depth, Williams (1973) is a must-read, arguing, from a broadly Humean position, that the genuine egoist is a psychopath, acknowledging the needs and interests of no-one else, and so poses no threat to morality. Other modern classics include McDowell (1978), responding to Foot, and Parfit (1984), on rational egoism (what he calls the self-interest theory). More recently, there’s Raz (1999), arguing that there is no theoretically interesting difference between moral and other values. Hills (2010) is a good book on the topic, examining various forms of egoism and responses to it before going on to offer what she calls a modest vindication of morality. Bloomfield, ed. (2008) is an edited volume containing lots of useful stuff—see especially the papers by Joyce, Nagel, Wedgwood, and Falk. See also Sober’s paper on psychological egoism in <strong>LF&amp;P</strong>, and any of the other papers in Section I of <strong>Sher</strong> and Part III of <strong>SL</strong>. Egoism, associated with Hobbes and Mandeville and criticised by Butler and Hume, was one of the main positions in the early modern debate. See Ch. 13 of Hobbes’ <em>Leviathan</em>, Mandeville’s <em>The Fable of the Bees</em>, sermons I and XI of Butler’s <em>Sermons at the Rolls Chapel</em>, and Hume’s <em>Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</em>. If you’re interested in looking more closely at these—worth doing for next week’s topic—you’ll find everything you need in <strong>Raphael</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>If you decide to pursue this topic further, the main issues to think about are (a) Hume’s account of motivation, and his criticisms of moral rationalism; (b) his sentimentalist account of morality; and (c) his account of justice and promise keeping—though it’s mainly the first of these issues that comes up in past papers. While the <em>Treatise</em> is the main primary text, you should also look at his moral <em>Enquiry</em>, Hume (1751/77), where he presents things a bit differently—and, among other things, criticises egoism. Hume thought that it was “incomparably the best” of his writings. Also look at certain of his essays, found in Hume (1777)—particularly ‘<a href="https://davidhume.org/texts/empl/1/sc">The Sceptic</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://davidhume.org/texts/empl/1/st">Of the Standard of Taste</a>’. Turning to the secondary literature, the articles by Charlotte Brown, Kate Abramson, and Eugene Lecaldano in Part III of Radcliffe, ed. (2008) are good surveys of the issues. Baillie (2000), aimed at undergraduates, is a good book-length introduction to Hume’s ethics. See also the lectures on Hume in Rawls (2000). Hume is commonly interpreted as a forerunner of various positions in contemporary metaethics, as in, e.g., Mackie (1980). For discussion, see: Railton’s contribution to <strong>Copp</strong>; the articles by Elizabeth Radcliffe, Tom Beauchamp, and Nicholas Sturgeon in Part VI of Radcliffe, ed. (2008); and the entries on <a href="#non-cognitivism"><strong>NON-COGNITIVISM and QUASI-REALISM</strong></a>, <a href="#motivational_internalism"><strong>MOTIVATIONAL INTERNALISM</strong></a>, and, especially, <a href="#reasons_internalism"><strong>HUMEANISM and REASONS INTERNALISM</strong></a>. But you should also take a look at Cohon (2008), arguing that the standard interpretation of Hume as anticipating various views in contemporary metaethics is mistaken. Note that recent past papers have tended not include questions that explicitly mention Hume, but they do nevertheless contain questions that provide you with an opportunity to display knowledge of his work in moral philosophy—and, typically, of how it differs from Kant’s. See the entry for <a href="#duty"><strong>KANT I: DUTY</strong></a> and the paper by David Wiggins that is listed there as Further Reading.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The 1970s and 80s saw a resurgence of interest in Kant’s ethics, largely due to the work of John Rawls and his students, Barbara Herman, Christine Korsgaard, and Onora O’Neill. His Harvard lectures on Kant’s ethics can be found in his (2000) book, listed in the Further Reading for <a href="#hume"><strong>HUME’S ETHICS</strong></a>. The first lecture on Kant is of most relevance for this week’s topic, and the second for next week’s, but all of the lectures on Kant are recommended. Beyond this, if you are pursuing this topic in depth, Baron (1995) is essential. Part I addresses the worry—raised by Susan Wolf (1982)—that Kant’s emphasis on duty leaves no room for <em>supererogatory</em> actions, actions that go beyond the call of duty. Part II addresses the worry—raised by Stocker (1976) and Williams (1976)—that it leaves no room for motives like love and friendship. (These are issues we’ll come back to.) Arpaly (2003), discussing the case of Huckleberry Finn, argues that moral worth is a matter of acting for moral reasons, regardless of whether the agent recognises them as such. Sliwa (2016) is a response. Note that recent past papers have tended not include questions that explicitly mention Kant, but they do nevertheless contain questions that provide you with an opportunity to display knowledge of his work. As mentioned above, recent questions relating to Kant’s views about duty and moral worth have often been opportunities to display knowledge of the differences between Kant’s work and Hume’s. See <a href="#hume"><strong>HUME’S ETHICS</strong></a>. Wiggins (1991) is particularly helpful in thinking about the contrasts here.</p>

<p>O’Neill (1985) and Herman (1985) are two influential pieces on universalizability. O’Neill argues that, properly understood, Kantian universalization yields substantive constraints on action, while Herman argues that its use in moral deliberation presupposes knowledge of rules that guide the agent in the perception of morally relevant features of the circumstances in which the agent acts, and goes on to argue that this helps address various criticisms that have been pressed against Kantian approaches. The rest of Part I of Wood (1999) develops a reading that opposes what he sees as the caricature of Kant as a rule fetishist who offers little more than an “ethical sausage-machine” for outputting right actions. He sets out the essentials of this reading in Wood (2017), an excellent, short book that focuses on the various formulas of the Categorical Imperative that Kant gives in the <em>Groundwork</em>. Other pieces that are useful in thinking about Kant’s formulas include: Parfit (2011), a fairly exhaustive investigation of the different interpretations of the Formulas of Universal Law and Laws of Nature; the rest of Part One of Korsgaard (1996); and the lectures on Kant in Rawls (2000), listed in the Further Reading for <a href="#hume"><strong>HUME’S ETHICS</strong></a>. You’ll find discussion of all the issues raised over the last two weeks in Hill Jr., ed. (2009), an accessible collection of articles on Kant’s ethics, and Timmermann (2007), just one of many commentaries on Kant’s <em>Groundwork</em>, but one that I have found helpful. As mentioned above, recent past papers have tended not include questions that explicitly mention Kant, but they still contain questions that provide you with an opportunity to display knowledge of his work. It’s a good idea, however, to think more generally about universalizability, not just as it occurs in Kant’s moral philosophy. To this end, you might start by having a look at the discussion in Wiggins (1987).</p>

<p>Many of you will be familiar with consequentialism from your first year study of Mill’s <em>Utilitarianism</em>, but in case you aren’t, Sinnott-Armstrong (2003/15) will get you up to speed. In further study, your main task will be to get a handle on how consequentialists have responded to various objections to their view, especially the demandingness objection. One strategy is to argue that it is not unreasonable for a morality to make the sorts of extreme demands that consequentialism is alleged to make. This is Singer’s strategy. It’s also the strategy pursued by Kagan (1989), a particularly influential book, which is well worth prioritising in further study of this week’s topic. Ashford (2000) pursues a similar line in response to Williams’ integrity objection. §2.1 of Mulgan (2001) critically discusses the strategy, which, following Kagan, he calls <em>extremism</em>, while Cullity (1994) is a response to Singer (1972). Another strategy is to deny that consequentialism gives rise to extreme demands in the first place. Jackson (1991) is an influential attempt of this sort, arguing that, since we can be more certain of maximizing utility if we focus our efforts on those closest to us, consequentialism does not require us to make the sorts of great personal sacrifice that its opponents sometimes claim. See §2.2 of Mulgan (2001) for critical discussion. Perhaps the most common strategy, however, is to argue that potential conflict with common-sense morality can be addressed by some <em>variant</em> of consequentialism. Scheffler (1982) and Railton (1984), in the Core Reading, are instances of this strategy, arguing that conflicts can be addressed by, respectively, hybrid or indirect forms of consequentialism. Kagan (1989) discusses Scheffler (see esp. Ch. 1 and 7), while Mason (1998) defends Railton. Hooker’s contribution to <strong>LF&amp;P</strong> pursues this line too, arguing that rule-consequentialism addresses the worry, while Norcross (2006) argues for a <em>scalar approach</em>. For critical discussion, see Mulgan (2001), starting with §2.3. Sobel (2007) takes a different line altogether, arguing that the demandingness objection depends for its force on prior non-consequentialist conclusions that need to be independently motivated.</p>

<p>In pursuing this topic in more depth, start by trying to get clear on what exactly the view is. It’s useful here to think about the objection that Scanlon’s contractualism is explanatorily redundant. Stratton-Lake (2003) explains why initial formulations of this objection were based on a misunderstanding, argues that the objection nevertheless re-emerges, and then goes on to offer a solution. Read that, and then read Ridge (2003), which argues that Scanlon cannot avail himself of Stratton-Lake’s solution to the “new and improved” redundancy objection without giving up some of his central commitments, but that contractualism’s not vulnerable to the objection in the first place. Next, think about the appeal of Scanlon’s contractualism, which lies in large part in its promise of accounts that are superior to those of its rivals of both the content and status of a central core of morality. The debate in the secondary literature debate has focused mainly on the contractualist’s account of the content of morality, and particularly on whether it offers an adequate response to worries about aggregation, demandingness, and risk. For more on the aggregation issue, try Otsuka (2006) and Parfit (2011). For discussion of demandingness, see Hills (2010). For discussion of risk, see Horton (2017). You will also want to think about the contractualist account of the status of morality. For this, Ch. 4 of <em>What We Owe to Each Other</em> is essential. See also Wallace (2002), which is helpful on this and many other issues.</p>

<p>Virtue ethics emerged as an alternative to the two main approaches to normative ethics, consequentialism and deontology, in the second half of the twentieth century, but continues to draw much of its inspiration from Aristotle and his <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, which is essential reading—regardless of whether you plan on working on virtue ethics in any depth, really. Beyond that, start with Crisp and Slote, eds. (1997), especially the papers by Elizabeth Anscombe, Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell, as well as the very useful editors’ introduction. Highlights of recent work on the topic include Swanton (2003), presenting a detailed pluralistic account of the virtues, Driver (2004), defending a broadly consequentialist approach to the virtues, and Annas (2011), developing the idea that virtue is an exercise of practical intelligence. Aim to get a good grip on the various objections that have been raised against virtue ethics. Section 3 of Hursthouse and Pettigrew (2003/16), above, gives an overview, outlining eight different kinds of criticism. Part III of Besser-Jones and Slote, eds. (2015) is also very useful, containing surveys of work on a range of problems for virtue ethics. Many of these are variants of objections pressed against more traditional approaches in normative ethics, and it’s worth thinking about them in that context. One exception to this general rule is the <em>situationist objection</em>, which emerged out of work in social psychology. It is pressed by Harman (1999), and there’s a lot of discussion of it in the literature. Miller (2014) is a good place to start.</p>

<p>Are virtue ethicists committed to the view that those who find it easier to be good are more praiseworthy for being good? What does your answer imply about the plausibility of virtue ethics? (2019)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) ‘Do we really want a moral theory to tell us what to do? Aren’t we losing an important sense in which we should be making our own decisions? Suppose I later come to think that what I did was actually the wrong thing to do … in the moral case there is surely something problematic in the thought that either I got the theory wrong or the theory was wrong, but there is no worry as to my making the wrong decision.’ (ANNAS) Is this a good defence of virtue ethics against the objection that it is not adequately action-guiding?<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
(b) Can virtue ethicists make sense of the idea that the grounds of our duties to others are facts about those others? (2018)</p>

<p>‘[A] virtuous action is what a virtuous person would do…this is not something fixed but will depend on whether the virtuous person is a learner or more like an expert.’ (ANNAS) Discuss. (2017)</p>

<p>Moral realism comes in either of two varieties. Put crudely, <em>moral naturalism</em> is the view that moral properties are natural properties, while <em>moral non-naturalism</em> is the view that they are non-natural properties. For a long time, Moore’s (1903) open question argument was taken to show that moral properties had to be <em>sui generis</em>, non-natural properties, and so to show that non-naturalism was the only option for moral realists. Yet non-natural properties seem to be metaphysically dubious, or “queer”, as Mackie put it, and it’s difficult to see how we might provide a plausible account of how we can come to know about them. Many theorists therefore chose to reject moral realism altogether. Developments in the philosophy of language and mind led to a rethink, however, and the 1980s saw a resurgence of interest in moral naturalism, largely due to the work of the so-called <em>Cornell realists</em>, Boyd, Brink, Railton, and Sturgeon. See Lutz and Lenman (2006/18) for an overview, and think especially about the Moral Twin Earth objection to Cornell realism. Then try Sturgeon (1985), Brink (1989), and Jackson (1998)—the last the most prominent defender of the so-called <em>Canberra Plan</em>. More recently, there’s been a recent resurgence of interest in non-naturalism. See Ridge (2003/14) for an overview, and think especially about the supervenience problem. Then try McDowell (1985), a classic discussion of Mackie, and Shafer-Landau (2003) and Enoch (2011), two highlights of the recent revival. For a discussion and defence of Mackie’s argument(s) from queerness, see Olson (2014).</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration:line-through">(a) Is motivational externalism committed to viewing good and strong-willed people as in the grip of moral fetishism?</span><br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
(b) Could moral beliefs be intrinsically motivating? (2019) <!-- HUMEANISM--></p>

<p>‘The omnipresence of desires in action is misleading, for it suggests that a desire must form the basis of every motivation. But in fact … [the desire] may often be motivated by precisely what motivates the action.’ (NAGEL) Discuss. (2018) <!-- HUMEANISM--></p>

<p>‘If there are normative reasons for action, it must be that people sometimes act for those reasons, and if they do, the reasons must figure in some correct explanation of their actions.’ Discuss. (2017) <!-- Williams quote --></p>

<p>‘To say that they possessed a reason … while acknowledging that any justificatory force of this reason is inaccessible to them as reasoning beings is, I think, not only a misuse of language, but undermines the point of discourse about reasons and rationality.’ (GERALD GAUS) Discuss. (2016) <!-- REASONS internalism --></p>

<!--

**EITHER**  
<span style='text-decoration:line-through'>(a) ‘Since morals have an influence on the actions and affections, it follows that they cannot be derived from reason... Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.’ (HUME) Discuss.</span>  
**OR**  
(b) ‘It is no more puzzling that beliefs alone can motivate us than that desires alone can – it is merely less common that they do.’ Is that so? (2014) <!-- HUMEANISM

<p>The further literature on this week’s topic is vast. With that, however, there is also a lot of good introductory literature. Gary Watson’s ‘Introduction’ to <strong>Watson</strong> is very helpful, offering a great overview of the issues, and you’ll find several useful entries in the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia</em>; the Related Entries section at the bottom of McKenna and Coates (2004/15), listed above, provides links. If you want a good book on the topic, aimed at advanced undergraduates, try McKenna and Pereboom (2016). In pursuing the topic in depth, you’ll want to think a bit more about van Inwagen’s consequence argument. The main thing to look at here is Lewis (1981). You’ll also want to think a bit more about Frankfurt’s challenge to the Principle of Alternate Possibilities and Peter Strawson’s account of moral responsibility in terms of reactive attitudes. To that end, Widerker and McKenna (2006) and McKenna and Russell (2008) are useful collections of articles, the former focused on Frankfurt and the latter on Strawson. But the main thing to do is familiarise yourself with contemporary libertarian, compatibilist, and sceptical approaches to free will and moral responsibility. See, in the first place, Chisholm (1964), Frankfurt (1971), Wolf (1987), and Strawson (1994). Then go on and look at the other papers in <b>Watson</b>, using the introductory literature above as your guide.</p>

<p>‘If a neuroscientist implanted electrodes in my brain and thereby induced in me attitudes that deterministically led me to wholeheartedly perform a certain crime, then she, and not I, would be morally responsible for the crime.’ Do you agree? What does your answer imply about the plausibility of compatibilism? (2019)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) ‘The freedom discovered in reflection is not a theoretical property which can also be seen by scientists considering the agent’s deliberations third-personally and from outside. It is from within the deliberative perspective that we see our desires as providing suggestions which we may take or leave.’ (KORSGAARD) Discuss.<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
(b) ‘Arguments for compatibilism based on Frankfurt-style cases face a dilemma. If the inevitability of the agent’s action given the “prior sign” is grounded in causal determinism, then the question is begged against the incompatibilist. But if we eliminate the causal determination then the agent has robust alternative possibilities after all.’ Discuss. (2018)</p>

<p>‘We don’t need to be free; it’s enough that we can’t help regarding ourselves as free.’ Is that so? (2017)</p>

<p>‘The problem of free will has been misrepresented insofar as it has been thought to be a purely metaphysical problem.’ (SUSAN WOLF) Discuss. (2016)</p>

<!--
How free does the will need to be? (2015)  

‘If an act can be ascribed to a person’s will, then that person is responsible for that act. Whether their will was free or not is irrelevant.’ Discuss. (2014)-->
