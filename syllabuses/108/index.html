<h1 id="philosophy-of-logic-and-language">Philosophy of Logic and Language</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Logic and Language. Many of the readings are online, and easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/108%20Philosophy%20of%20Logic%20and%20Language.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS: LANGUAGE</strong>. The first two weeks look at classic works by Frege and Russell. We then spend two weeks thinking about general issues concerning the distinction between semantics, pragmatics, and meaning, before looking at issues arising out of work in the 1970s by Kripke, Kaplan, and Putnam. The last week is left open for a topic of your choice. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS: LOGIC</strong> and the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. Having discussed it with me beforehand, however, you may choose to cover a quite different set of topics. (Those interested in the philosophy of logic might want to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS: LOGIC</strong> instead of the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS: LANGUAGE</strong>.)</p>

<p>I’ve had advice from various friends and colleagues in putting together this reading list and its previous incarnations. I’m particularly grateful to Brian Ball, Nick Tasker, and various students over the years. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of this reading list at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<p>The following anthologies are particularly useful, and contain many of the key readings, at least in the philosophy of language. I refer to them below as <strong>Harnish</strong>, <strong>Ludlow</strong>, and <strong>M&amp;S</strong> respectively.</p>

<p>There is no set textbook, but it will be useful to do some introductory reading in the vacation beforehand as well as afterwards, for revision. The following are all warmly recommended:</p>

<div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;">

<p class="bibliography" style="margin-bottom:0;">

</div>

<p>Lycan (2019) and Morris (2007) focus on the philosophy of language, with Lycan (2019) being a bit better on general issues about meaning and Morris (2007) a bit better on issues about reference, while Read (1995) and Sainsbury (2001) are more focused on the philosophy of logic.</p>

<h4 id="essay-question">ESSAY QUESTION</h4>

<p>Why did Frege distinguish between sense and reference? Was he right to do so? If so, what is the sense of a proper name, such as ‘Hesperus’? If not, how is the informativeness of an identity statement, such as ‘Hesperus is Phosphorus’, to be explained?</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Other relevant writings by Frege include his (1918) paper, which is well worth reading in connection with <a href="#indexicals"><strong>INDEXICALS and DEMONSTRATIVES</strong></a> as well. Contemporary scholarship on Frege is dominated by Michael Dummett’s work, especially his magisterial (1981). Chapter 5 discusses the sense-reference distinction. Burge’s writings on Frege, collected in his (2005), are no less essential, and probably more sensitive to textual and historical considerations. Part II focuses on sense and cognitive value, though the best place to start is ‘Frege on Truth’, first published in 1986, in Part I. Michael Kremer’s contribution to the same volume as Taschek’s, above, is also very helpful, as are Heck and May (2008) and the rest of Textor (2011). McDowell (1977) is another piece of essential reading, articulating a non-descriptive Fregean approach, but it is quite hard going; it will be easier to understand the main idea after looking at Davidson’s proposal in the Core Reading for <a href="#meaning"><strong>MEANING</strong></a>. You might also want to look at the interpretation of Frege in Ch. 1 of Evans (1982), which offers a similar approach to McDowell’s. For more on the debate between Millians (or neo-Russellians) and Fregeans, see Caplan (2007) and Fodor (2008). For an introduction to <em>relationism</em>, an approach developed by Kit Fine, see Gray (2017).</p>

<p>NOTE: I’ve included questions from the <em>Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein</em> paper, which is discontinued. As I understand it, questions on Frege’s and Russell’s work in the philosophy of logic and language, which used to be set for that paper, will now be set for this paper instead—though I haven’t seen any yet.</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong>   <br />
<span style="text-decoration:line-through">(a) The name ‘Madagascar’ was originally used to refer to a portion of the African mainland but was then applied to its current bearer (the island) in error. Are cases like this fatal to Kripke’s ‘causal chain’ theory of the reference of proper names?</span><br />
<strong>OR</strong>   <br />
(b) ‘Kripke’s arguments against descriptivism show that names do not have sense as well as reference.’ Do you agree? (2018)</p>

<p>Do names have sense (Sinn) as well as reference (Bedeutung)? (2016, Paper 117)</p>

<p>To what extent do Frege’s reasons for ascribing sense and reference to proper names generalize to ascribing sense and reference to sentences? (2015, Paper 117)</p>

<p>‘Whilst it is plausible to suppose that words have a reference, and sentences a sense, it is not nearly so plausible to suppose that words have a sense and sentences a reference.’ Discuss, with reference to ONE or MORE of Frege, Russell, and the Tractatus. (2014, Paper 117)</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Kripke (1977) is a must-read, defending Russell in response to the problems raised by Donnellan. Neale (1990) is an influential exposition and defence of Kripke’s position. See also Recanati (1993), offering a <em>contextualist</em> account of Donnellan’s examples, and Michael Devitt’s contribution to Reimer and Bezuidenhout, eds. (2004), offering an <em>ambiguity</em> account. See also Zacharska (2010), criticising the ambiguity account, and defending the contextualist one. While Russell’s position was for a long time the orthodox position—thanks in large part to Neale (1990)—Strawson’s has made a come back in recent years. Kai von Fintel’s paper in Reimer and Bezuidenhout, eds. (2004) is important here. See also Yablo (2006) and Elbourne (2013). (Paul Elbourne is often an examiner for this paper, so it is a good idea to gain some familiarity with his views!) For more on the problem of incomplete descriptions, raised by Strawson, see Reimer (1998)<!-- and the Core Readings for the topic, [**QUANTIFIER DOMAIN RESTRICTION**](#qdr)-->. Ludlow (2004/18) is a useful overview of all the relevant issues.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In working on this topic in more depth, start by making sure you’ve got a good grasp of Grice’s own views. To this end, the rest of his (1989) <em>Studies in the Way of Words</em> is essential, particularly the other papers in Part I, <em>Logic and Conversation</em>. See also Saul (2002), arguing that the standard picture of Grice is mistaken. You should also think about the relationship between the category of conversational implicature, on the one hand, and those of conventional implicatures and presuppositions, on the other. For a good introduction, and further references, see Potts (2015). See also Bach (1999), arguing that there is no such thing as conventional implicature<!--, and the reading suggested for [**PRESUPPOSITION**](#presupposition)-->. Otherwise, think about the various refinements, objections, and alternatives to Grice’s theory that have emerged over the years. Key here are the approaches of neo-Griceans, like Larry Horn and Stephen Levinson, and Relevance Theorists, like Deirdre Wilson, Dan Sperber, and Robyn Carston. For good introductions, see the papers by Horn and by Wilson and Sperber in Horn and Ward, eds. (2004). See also Ernie Lepore and Matthew Stone’s (2015) book, building on work by David Lewis on convention and discourse structure to argue that phenomena traditionally explained in terms of general purpose reasoning are to instead be explained in terms of speakers’ knowledge of language. Part I introduces the Gricean, neo-Gricean, and Relevance Theoretic approaches, which are critically discussed in the rest of the book. The wider context is a debate over the contribution linguistic meaning and grammar makes to what is said and the significance of utterances more generally—the so-called <em>semantics-pragmatics holy wars</em>. Important early contributions to this debate include Carston (1988) and Bach (1994). See also <a href="#context-sensitivity"><strong>CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY</strong></a>. Recent debate often focuses on <em>scalar implicatures</em>, particularly in embedded contexts. Though it’s something of a special topic, you may want to get a sense of what the debate here is about; Sauerland (2012) is a good place to start. Lastly, see Davis (2005/19) for a survey article on conversational implicature.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-3">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The earlier chapters of Part II of Lycan (2019) discuss various other approaches to meaning, including the traditional view, associated with Locke, that the meaning of an expression is an idea. Wittgenstein was a critic of the traditional view, and, along with Wilfrid Sellars, a source of an alternative, use-based approach. For more on this, you might try Brandom (2000). See also the entry for <strong>LOGICAL INFERENTIALISM</strong>. For Grice’s approach, which seeks to explain linguistic meaning in terms of speakers’ intentions, see ‘Meaning’ in Grice (1989), and Neale (1992), both listed in the Core Reading for <a href="#implicatures"><strong>CONVERSATIONAL IMPLICATURES</strong></a>. Note that these are perhaps best understood as views about the metasemantic question, what determines the meaning of an expression, rather than the semantic question, what sort of thing <em>is</em> the meaning of an expression. So it’s not immediately obvious that they are in tension with the sorts of views you’ve been looking at this week. If you want to think more about those, start by thinking more about Davidson’s view. Focus, in particular, on getting a good grasp of Foster’s problem, and the main attempts to solve it, those of John McDowell and James Higginbotham, as well as Davidson himself. McDowell’s solution is found in his (1977) paper, listed under <a href="#frege"><strong>SENSE and REFERENCE</strong></a>. Platts (1997) and Wiggins (1997) are helpful guides to McDowell, but also to Davidson’s program more generally, and are strongly recommended. Higginbotham’s approach is set out in his (1992), and criticised by Soames (2003). Lewis (1980) develops his intensional approach in light of the double-indexing considerations that you might look at in connection with <a href="#indexicals"><strong>INDEXICALS and DEMONSTRATIVES</strong></a>. In thinking about his approach, you might also find the <strong>PROPOSITIONS</strong> topic helpful.  Think also about how proponents of truth-conditional approaches might handle non-indicatives. Stenius (1967) is a classic discussion of this issue, while Recanati (2013) is a good recent discussion.</p>

#### FURTHER READING  

In working on this topic, make sure you have a good grasp of Foster's problem and of the various solutions that have been offered for it. Segal (1999) gives a very nice, concise explanation of the issue before going on to present a solution, though the main approaches to think about are probably those of John McDowell and Jim Higginbotham. McDowell's is found in his (1977) paper, listed under [**SENSE and REFERENCE**](#frege). Platts (1997) and Wiggins (1997) are very helpful guides to McDowell, but also to the Davidsonian program more generally, and are strongly recommended. Higginbotham's approach is set out in his (1992). For critical discussion of this, see Soames (2008), to which Lepore and Ludwig (2010) is a response. Other general problems with the project of explaining meaning in terms of truth include the worry, raised early on by Michael Dummett in his (1959), that it is incompatible with deflationism about truth. There are also problems, arguably more concerning details of implementation, relating to non-declarative sentences, whose meanings aren't obviously amenable to explanation in terms of truth-conditions, and context-sensitivity. There's some discussion of the former in McDowell (1977), and you can think about the latter in connection with the topics [**INDEXICALS and DEMONSTRATIVES**](#indexicals) and, especially, [**CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY**](#context-sensitivity). You'll also find relevant discussion in the two books I've listed by Lepore and Ludwig. Context-sensitivity is discussed in Ch. 5 of their (2005), and non-declaratives in Ch. 12 of their (2007). For other writings by Davidson on the general topic of truth and meaning, see the other papers in (2001) collection, starting with his 'Radical Interpretation', which will be of particular interest if you're thinking about metasemantics and the sort of large-scale issues we first looked at in connection with [**NAMING and NECESSITY**](#kripke).

<p>Kripke offers arguments against descriptivist answers to both the <em>semantic</em> question of what, if anything, the meaning of a proper name is and the <em>metasemantic</em> question of how its referent is fixed—arguments known as his modal, epistemological, and semantic arguments. The two main lines of response to the modal argument are wide scope strategy, pursued in Dummett (1981), and the actualised description strategy, pursued in Searle (1983). Soames criticises these in the Core Reading, but see Sosa (2002) for a reply on behalf of the wide scope strategy. For more on the epistemological argument, see Jeshion (2002). Think also about what other answers we might give to the semantic and metasemantic questions. Some, like Katz (2001), think Kripke’s arguments leave untouched a non-Fregean descriptivism. See also Graff Fara (2015), defending the view that names are predicates. Others think they leave untouched a non-descriptivist Fregeanism. McDowell (1977), mentioned in the Further Reading for <a href="#frege"><strong>SENSE and REFERENCE</strong></a> is the <em>locus classicus</em> for this sort of view, but perhaps better in the first instance to look at Sainsbury (2005), listed in the Further Reading for <a href="#empty_names"><strong>EMPTY NAMES</strong></a>, which is a great guide to many of the issues we’ve been looking at. Kripke himself seems inclined, albeit tentatively, to Millianism, the view defended by Soames in the rest of his (2002) as well as by Salmon (1986) in the Core Reading for <a href="#frege"><strong>SENSE and REFERENCE</strong></a>, as an answer to the semantic question, and the causal theory of reference as an answer to the metasemantic question. For more on the causal theory of reference and metasemantics, see Dickie (2011), and §3 of Speaks (2010/19) for an overview of the broader issues. And see Cumming (2008/19) for an excellent overview of work on the semantics of names. Lastly, think about the puzzles that motivated descriptivism in the first place, particularly concerning <a href="#empty_names"><strong>EMPTY NAMES</strong></a> and <a href="#propositional_attitude_reports"><strong>PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDE REPORTS</strong></a>.</p>

<p>What are the most serious problems with Kaplan’s theory of indexicals and demonstratives? Can they be solved?</p>

<!--
Explain and assess Kaplan's theory of indexicals and demonstratives. What are its most serious problems? How, if at all, are they to be solved?

What is Kaplan's solution to the *puzzle of invariant meaning*, i.e. the fact that, while an indexical can be used to refer to different things on different occasions, its meaning nevertheless remains the same? What are the most serious problems with his solution? How, if at all, are they to be solved?-->

<!--For discussion of Frege's treatment of indexicals, see Perry (1977), arguing that it is inconsistent with certain aspects of Frege's views about sense, and Evans (1985), a reply. The trend in past papers has been to focus on Kaplan's theory, however. -->

<p>In thinking more about Kaplan’s theory, there are several issues to look at. First, there’s the role of speakers’ intentions in determining the reference of a demonstrative. For an influential debate on this, see Reimer (1991) and Bach (1992). Second, there’s a question of how true demonstratives, like ‘this’ and ‘that’, are best handled within the theory. See Braun (1996). Third, there’s Kaplan’s logic of indexicals. Relevant here is the so-called <em>answering machine</em> paradox. See Cohen and Michaelson (2013) for an accessible survey. See also Yagisawa (1993), challenging Kaplan’s view that arguments such as, <em>Mary is talking now; so Mary is talking now</em>, are valid. Students doing <strong>PHILOSOPHICAL LOGIC</strong> might also think about connections to issues surrounding <strong>TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOGIC</strong>. Fourth, there’s Kaplan’s claim that indexicals and demonstratives are directly referential. Relevant here are debates about the proper treatment of complex demonstratives. See, in particular, King (2008), defending his alternative view that complex demonstratives are quantifiers. See also Braun’s reply in the same volume. The general issue of whether indexicals and demonstratives are directly referential connects with questions about the nature of <strong>PROPOSITIONS</strong>. Last, think about alternative approaches to indexicals and demonstratives, especially Perry’s token-reflexive approach, which is introduced in his (2017). For good surveys of the issues, try Mount (2012) and (the more advanced) Braun (2001/15). Students comfortable with the notation of formal semantics will find Heim (n.d.) extremely helpful, too.</p>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in any depth, Pessin and Goldberg, eds. (1996) is extremely useful. Besides reprints of Putnam (1975) and Burge (1979), the papers of most immediate relevance are those in Part II, focused on natural kinds and the philosophy of language—see especially the papers by Zemach, Mellor, and Searle. See also Putnam’s introduction, which replies to Searle and Burge. Though it doesn’t tend to come up in exams, you might also want to think about Kripke’s approach to kind terms, rounding out your work on <a href="#kripke"><strong>NAMING and NECESSITY</strong></a>. See especially Lecture III of his <em>Naming and Necessity</em> and Ch. 9 to 11 of Soames (2002), listed in the Core Reading for <a href="#kripke"><strong>NAMING and NECESSITY</strong></a>.<!-- You'll often find reference to the Kripke-Putnam account of kind terms, and there are certainly some commonalities, but don't let such talk obscure the important differences between them in both theory and motivation. Hacking (2007) is excellent on this.--> See also Wikforss (2007), which carefully disentangles various externalist theses at stake in the debate, distinguishing Putnam’s claims from those of both Kripke and Burge. For some recent and sympathetic discussion of Chomsky, see Pietroski (2017). For an alternative sort of response, relevant also to the issues you looked at for <a href="#kripke"><strong>NAMING and NECESSITY</strong></a>, see Jackson (1998). For discussion of Jackson, see Ch. 4 of Kallestrup (2012), which also discusses the two-dimensionalist approach of Chalmers (2002). Segal (2004) offers an internalist account of natural kind concepts, and disputes the relevance of intuitions cited in support of externalism. Lastly, see Yli-Vakurri (2018) for a recent attempt to establish semantic externalism without thought experiments, and Sawyer (2018) for a reply.</p>

Sher (1999) discusses both Field's and other challenges to Tarski. Heck (1997) discusses the connection between Tarskian definitions of truth taken as, roughly, theories specifying the meanings of the sentences of the object-language and as theories of what 'true' means in the metalanguage.

<p>The background to everything this week is Tarski (1936), in which he first spelt out (a version of) the modern model-theoretic approach. Etchemendy (1990) spells out his case against the approach in more detail. See also McGee (1992), raising what he calls <em>the reliability problem</em>. <!--Roughly put, the problem is that, since the domain of a model is a set, and there is no set of all sets, models cannot represent all ways the universe could be. It thus seems that logical truth is not a reliable guide to truth: there may be sentences that, although true in all models, are not true. -->For defence of the model-theoretic approach, see Sher (1996), Hanson (1997), and Soames (1999). The main problem for the proof-theoretic approach was first raised by Prior (196), whose connective <em>tonk</em> seems to show that logical consequence cannot simply be identified with deducibility in some system or other. <!--Stevenson (1961) and Belnap (1962) are early responses to this problem. (-->Prawitz hopes to solve it by appealing to the notion of <em>harmony</em>; see Dummett (1991) for an excellent, albeit difficult, discussion. If you’re working on the topic in more depth, Caret and Hjortland, eds. (2015) will be invaluable. You might also want to look at the reading for <strong>LOGICAL INFERENTIALISM</strong>, examining the suggestion that understanding a logical constant is a matter of being disposed to reason in accordance with its introduction and elimination rules. Also take a look at the reading for <a href="#constants"><strong>LOGICAL CONSTANTS</strong></a>, examining the question of how, if at all, logical and nonlogical constants are to be distinguished from each other.</p>

<!-- Link to LOGICAL INFERENTIALISM in the guide. Proof-theoretic approach often tied to (and depends for its neat solution to epistemological problems on) an inferentialist account of understanding (to understand connective is to be disposed in accordance with inference rules): Boghossian, Peacocke?? Simple objection from Williamson: theorists can share understanding but recommend change in practice. -->

<p>If you are investigating it in more depth, Peacocke (1976) and Hacking (1979) are two classics on this topic. Peacocke attempts to characterise logical constants in terms of the idea, roughly put, that acquaintance with their meaning enables one to know <em>a priori</em> that certain sentences containing them are true. Hacking offers a broadly proof-theoretic approach, on which logical constants are those whose meanings can be characterised in terms of (roughly) their rules of inference. Peacocke himself came to endorse something more like Hacking’s view—see the entry for <strong>LOGICAL INFERENTIALISM</strong>. Tarski, in ‘On the Concept of Logical Consequence’, expressed some scepticism about the prospects of a principled demarcation of the logical constants, but later proposed <em>permutation invariance</em> as a criterion; see his (1986), a transcript of a talk given in 1966. The proposal has come to be known as the Sher-Tarski thesis, after Gila Sher’s defence of it in her (1991) book, and has been the subject of considerable recent debate. For a sample, try Sagi (2015) and Zinke’s (2018) reply. For Sher’s own views, try her (2003) response to Gómez-Torrente. Other good pieces include Dutilh Novaes (2012), arguing that “the project of demarcating the class of logical constants as a means to define the scope and nature of logic rests on highly problematic assumptions” and Warmbrōd (1999), arguing for a <em>pragmatic</em> demarcation.</p>

For more on Cappelen and Lepore's *semantic minimalism* (and speech act pluralism) see their (2005) book, and two symposiums on the book, one in <i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i> **72**(2) and the other in <i>Mind & Language</i> **21**(1). See also Borg (2004), who pursues a similar approach, appealing to some ideas in the philosophy of cognitive science. For *indexicalism*, see Szabó (2001) and the various papers collected in Stanley (2005)&mdash;the introduction is very helpful. See also the position defended in Rothschild and Segal (2009). Semantic minimalism and indexicalism are opposed by both Travis and so-called *contextualists*, like Robyn Carston and François Récanati. See Carston (2002) and Récanati (2004) respectively, the latter engaged, among other things, in a debate with Stanley over so-called unarticulated constituents, a debate which has been the focus of recent past paper questions. Other views to think about include the *nonindexical contextualism* of Predelli (2005), also explored by John Macfarlane, and the view that context-shifting arguments highlight shifts in the linguistic meaning of words like 'green', defended by Williamson in his (1999) paper.

<p>Kripke (2011) is a short version of his influential Locke lectures, which were delivered in 1973 and which circulated in manuscript form before being finally published as a book, Kripke (2013). They set out an influential, broadly Millian approach to the problems of apparently empty names, and are essential reading if you are pursuing the topic in more depth. There are also other Millian approaches out there, and you should also work through the details of some of these. Try, in particular, Salmon (1998) and Braun (2005). One of Kripke’s proposals is that fictional names, like ‘Sherlock Holmes’, refer to abstract objects of a certain sort. This is taken up by both Salmon and Braun, and also by Amie Thomasson, who has perhaps explored the idea in most detail. See, for example, her (2003). Have a think, also, about some alternative approaches to fictional names. Lewis (1978) offers a possibilist account, making use of his infamous modal realism. This is usefully contrasted with the perhaps even more radical position of Meinongians, like Parsons (1982). Kroon and Voltolini (2018) is a good overview of the issues hereabouts. Sainsbury develops his views about empty names in more detail in his (2005) book, which is strongly recommended. See especially the first chapter, which offers a concise history of work on names, deftly summarising issues and debates we’ve been looking at throughout the term so far. In thinking about Sainsbury’s approach, have a look at Ray’s paper in García Carpintero and Martí, eds. (2014), which argues that the problems posed by (genuinely) empty names have a straightforward solution, superficially similar to Sainsbury’s, but making no use of free logic. Do you agree? Many other papers in García Carpintero and Martí, eds. (2014) are also helpful.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-13">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>For Frege’s and Russell’s views on this topic, you can revisit the readings  by them in earlier weeks. Also look at Salmon (1986) from the Core Reading for <a href="#frege"><strong>SENSE and REFERENCE</strong></a> and Soames (2002) from the Core Reading for <a href="#kripke"><strong>NAMING and NECESSITY</strong></a>, both defending the main neo- or naive Russellian approach. For an alternative naive Russellian approach, try Braun (1998). Burge (1986) and Schiffer (1987) are two important critical pieces on Davidson’s approach. See Rumfitt (1993) for a defence. Schiffer (1992) is a sympathetic, albeit critical piece on Crimmins and Perry-style contextualism. Richard (2017) is a recent survey piece, written by a proponent of an alternative brand of contextualism. Richard also discusses two recent developments, the descriptivism defended by the likes of Bach (1997) and the relationism developed by Fine (2007). Saul (2007) argues that substitution failures arise in ordinary, extensional contexts, and looks at the implications for semantic theorising more generally.</p>

For more on situation theory, as well as its application to this issue, see Kratzer (2007/17). Stanley (2002) is in some ways a superior presentation of the Stanley and Szabó approach.

## ASSERTORIC CONTENT AND INGREDIENT SENSE
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is the relationship between the *ingredient sense* of a sentence, i.e. the contribution that it makes to the truth-conditions of sentences in which it occurs, and its *assertoric content*, i.e. what it can be used on its own to say or assert?

**CORE READING**  
There isn't a great deal of introductory stuff on this topic, but there is a short discussion in §3.2 of:

**FURTHER READING**  
Dummett first discussed the relationship between ingredient sense and assertoric content explicitly in his (1973) book, *Frege: Philosophy of Language*, though the roots go back to his (1959) article, 'Truth'. His (2004) is a concise, and fairly accessible discussion. Glanzberg (2011) is a nice, short piece on the issues surrounding the semantics of tense. Ninan (2012) is a response to King. Mackay (2013) argues for "monsters", or context-shifting operators. Stojnic (2017) is a nice recent paper on the topic, critically discussing an appeal Jason Stanley makes to the assertoric content-ingredient sense distinction.
