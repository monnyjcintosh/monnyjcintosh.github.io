<h1 id="knowledge--reality">Knowledge &amp; Reality</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge &amp; Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, but I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of these. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. (I’ve also listed some <strong>ADVANCED TOPICS</strong>, which presuppose some familiarity with other topics, and which some students have wanted to explore. These are less likely to come up in exams.)</p>

Is knowledge closed under known entailment? What significance does the issue have for the problem of external-world scepticism?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Vogel (1990) defends epistemic closure. Roush (2005) defends Nozick’s sensitivity account of knowledge. Dretske and Hawthorne (2014) debate epistemic closure: Hawthorne argues for, and Dretske against. Kvanvig (2008) is a nice overview of the issues. Holliday (2015) is a formal piece, but accessible to students who have taken Philosophical Logic. It argues that, once externalist theories of knowledge are formalised, counterexamples to epistemic closure can be seen to be inevitable.</p>

<p>NOTE: This week, together with a tutorial on <strong><a href="#epistemic_closure">EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</a></strong>, prepares you for some of the main approaches to external world scepticism.</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is epistemic contextualism? How does it differ from subject-sensitive invariantism? Is it correct? Does it offer a satisfactory response to the problem of external-world scepticism?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
DeRose (2009), the first of two volumes, is a statement and defence of contextualism. DeRose (2018), the second volume, is just out, and focuses on the application to scepticism and lottery puzzles. Brown (2006) defends an orthodox invariantist position, opposed both to contextualism and the subject-sensitive invariantism (SSI) endorsed by the likes of Hawthorne and Stanley. The debate between contextualism and SSI raises questions about the role of pragmatic elements in knowledge, or so-called <em>pragmatic encroachment</em>. Fantl and McGrath (2009) is a great discussion of this. Conee and Cohen (2014) is a useful debate for and against contextualism. It includes, among other things, discussion of whether contextualism provides a satisfactory response to scepticism.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Is there any reason to think that ‘knows’ is context sensitive? What significance would it have for epistemology if this were so? (2016)</p>

<p>Can positing variation across contexts of standards for ascribing knowledge help solve sceptical puzzles? (2015)</p>

<p>Are there any reasons to think that ‘know’ is context-sensitive, other than its potentially affording a response to scepticism? (2014)</p>

<p>‘When S knows that p, that is a non-linguistic fact about S’s mental state. That fact will obtain regardless of the linguistic context, and, hence, S will know that p in every such context. So epistemic contextualism is false.’ Discuss. (2012)</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
If you are pursuing this topic in more depth, you should read Ch. 2 and 3 of Williamson (2000), which flesh out his claim that knowledge is a mental state. Zagzebski (1994) presents a recipe for constructing Gettier-style counterexamples to (certain sorts of) analyses of knowledge. (Jennifer Nagel introduces this and Williamson’s view in this short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll9xlNi2-mI">video</a>.) Lowe (2002) is a useful review of <em>Knowledge and its Limits</em>, critically discussing Williamson’s claim that knowledge is a mental state. For more sympathetic discussion of the claim, see Yablo (2003) and Nagel (2013). Hyman (2014) criticises Williamson’s claim that knowledge is the most general factive stative attitude.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the first three chapters of David Lewis’s (1986) book are essential reading. The first lays out a case for his brand of modal realism, the second defends it from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. Bricker and Melia (2008) is a recent debate; they defend concretism and ersatzism respectively. The remaining suggestions all discuss other approaches. Rosen (1990) defends a fictionalist approach. Melia (1992) argues against modalism, the view (roughly) that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explicated in terms of objects’ essences.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
The literature for this topic is huge. Hume (1748) is essential reading. After that, your first port of call should be Sosa and Tooley (1993), which contains Mackie (1965) and Lewis (1973) as well as various other classic papers; the ones by Anscombe, Davidson, Kim, Salmon, and Tooley are especially recommended. Psillos (2003) is a good introduction to the main approaches, including those of Wesley Salmon and James Woodward, who introduce their positions themselves in Salmon (2002) and Woodward (2001/8) respectively. Alex Broadbent gives some helpful guidance on how to approach further work on causation <a href="http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/causation.html">here</a>.</p>

Haslanger and Kurtz (2006) is an extremely useful collection, containing the relevant selection from Lewis (1986) and tons of other classic pieces on this topic. It should be your first port of call for further work on this topic. Hawthorne (2008) and Effingham (2012) are two good discussions of various issues concerning persistence. Einheuser (2012) is a nice discussion of the question whether there is a genuine problem of change. Magidor (2016) is another nice discussion, running through a host of different arguments that are offered in the literature, arguing that they are strictly orthogonal to the debate between endurantists and perdurantists.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
‘The following two claims are in tension: (1) There can be change over time; (2) At least some non-essential properties of objects are intrinsic.’ Explain how this tension might most plausibly be thought to arise. How would you propose to resolve it? (2016)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) ‘Consider a headless statue called “HEADLESS”. Suppose that at some later time T HEADLESS has been augmented by attaching a head to it. Call the whole statue after this augmentation “HEADY”. Consider the portion of HEADY consisting of the whole statue except for its head, and call that object “HEADY-MINUS”. On the one hand, we should say that HEADLESS has gained a head and is thus identical to HEADY. On the other hand, we should say that HEADLESS is identical to HEADY- MINUS. But these statements cannot both be true.’ How should this quandary be resolved? <strong>OR</strong> (b) Are there any good reasons to prefer the view that objects persist by perduring rather than by enduring?

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
For an introduction to the other main issues for this topic, you can’t do better than chapters 3 to 8 of Dainton (2010). B-theorists face the problem of accounting for the fact that time passes. Or if it doesn’t, of accounting for the fact that it seems to: we experience time as passing. They also have to explain the apparent asymmetry of our attitudes, e.g. of hope, dread, etc., towards the past and the future. Mellor (1998) tackles these and other problems for the B-theorist. On the A-theory side of things, try Lowe (2002) and, for a recent survey of presentism, Ingram and Tallant (2018). Another thing to think about is time travel. Is it possible? Does it pose a problem for particular views about the nature of time? Lewis (1976) defends the possibility of time travel, and Wasserman (2017) is a recent book looking at a range of issues.</p>

<p>An item is grue if and only if either it is observed before a certain time T and is green, or it is not observed before T and is blue. Suppose that over 10,000 emeralds have been observed prior to time T and all were grue. Should one on that basis expect the first emerald observed after T to be grue? (2015)</p>

<p>What would it take to solve the problem of induction? (2014)</p>

<p>Whether induction is rational is one question; whether induction is reliable is another. Need anything more be said to resolve the problem of induction? (2013)</p>

Can one know that something is the case simply because one has been told that it is? If not, does it follow that we know far less than we ordinarily take ourselves to know?</p>

Adler (2006/12) is a useful overview of the issues. Coady (1992) is a classic defence of anti-reductionism. Lipton (1998) defends reductionism, as does Fricker (2006). Lackey (2007) argues that anti-reductionism is incompatible with virtue epistemology, the idea that knowledge is something for which subjects deserve credit.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
How readily should one believe what others tell one? (2016)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) ‘Understanding other people’s eye-witness accounts affords one epistemic access to states of affairs they have observed and now report, in much the same way that one’s memory affords one present access to past states of affairs which one oneself once observed.’ Discuss. <strong>OR</strong> (b) To what extent does one’s dependence on others for much of what one knows compromise one’s ability to take responsibility for one’s own beliefs? (2015)</p>

<p>‘Insofar as observations could undermine our entitlement to trust testimony, so also testimonies could undermine our entitlement to trust particular observations.’ Is this true? Does it follow that testimony and observation are equally basic as sources of knowledge? (2013)</p>

<p>Can there be such a thing as knowledge by testimony alone? (2011)</p>
