<h1 id="philosophy-of-logic-and-language">Philosophy of Logic and Language</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Logic and Language. Many of the readings are online, and easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything. </p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/108%20Philosophy%20of%20Logic%20and%20Language.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>. </p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, but I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of these. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Other essential pieces by Frege include ‘Function and Concept’ and ‘Thought’. Both are in Michael Beaney, ed. (1997) <em>The Frege Reader</em> (Blackwell) — and ‘Thought’ is widely anthologised. Contemporary discussion of Frege has been dominated by Michael Dummett’s writings, especially his magisterial (1981); chapter 5 discusses the sense-reference distinction. Burge’s writings on Frege, collected in his (2005), are no less essential, and more sensitive to textual and historical considerations. Part II focuses on sense and cognitive value, though perhaps the best place to start is ‘Frege on Truth’, first published in 1986, in Part I. McDowell (1977) is another essential piece. Gray (2017) is an introduction to an interesting alternative to Frege’s approach, associated with Kit Fine. Michael Kremer’s contribution to the same volume as Taschek’s above is very helpful, as is Heck and May (2008). </p>

If you want to pursue the sense/reference issue in more depth, Dummett (1981) is essential reading, as is McDowell (1977). Kremer (2010) and Taschek (2010) provide extremely useful discussions of the distinction between sense and reference as it developed in Frege's own thought and was critically received.

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Kripke (1977) is a must-read, defending a broadly Russellian position. Neale (1990) is an influential exposition and defence of Kripke’s position. Strawson’s approach has seen a recent revival, especially among linguists — von Fintel (2004) is a prominent example of this trend. The topic is a key battleground in debates over the semantics/pragmatics distinction; Recanati (1993) and Stanley and Szabó (2000) are two key contributions. </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Stanley (1997) adapts a line of reasoning pressed against Kripke in Dummett (1981). (Dummett’s objection is quite different to Stanley’s, however.) Jackson (1998) responds to Kripke’s modal argument by arguing that names are abbreviations of so-called actualised descriptions. Jeshion (2002) is a response to Kripke’s epistemological argument. Soames (2002) discusses a wide range of different responses to Kripke, and would be an excellent place to start in pursuing this topic in more depth. Burgess (2014) critically discusses Evans’ challenge to the causal theory of reference.  </p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What problems do apparently empty names pose for accounts of proper names? How are they best solved?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Salmon (1998), Thomasson (2003), and Braun (2005) offer views with many affinities with Kripke’s. It is well worth working through the details of these, and the ways in which they differ from one another and Kripke. Ray (2014) is an interesting recent paper, arguing that the problems posed by (genuinely) empty names have a surprisingly straightforward solution. As he explains, the solution he puts forward is superficially similar to Sainsbury’s, but makes no use of free logic. Textor (2016) is a survey piece on approaches to empty (or “vacuous”) names in early analytic philosophy.</p>

<!-- Nathan Salmon has a view with many affinities to Kripke's. See, e.g., his (1998). For more on fictional characters, see Thomasson (2003). Jeshion (2001) criticises the idea that theoretical terms like 'Vulcan' are introduced by description. Caplan (2004) attempts to extend van Inwagen's approach to theoretical terms. -->

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Travis (1991) and Neale (1992) are two contrasting surveys of Grice’s work. Broadly speaking, Travis is critical and Neale sympathetic. Conventional implicatures have long been viewed with suspicion. Karttunen and Peters (1979) argued that they are simply presuppositions, and Carston (2002) (among other things) presents a relevance-theoretic case against them. But Christopher Potts has recently argued for the need for a separate category of conventional implicatures. See his (2007), which condenses themes from his earlier book. </p>

In pursuing this topic in any depth, Kratzer (1986) is essential, arguing that “if” is not a two-place connective, but rather a device for restricting the domains of certain operators. Bennett (2001) is an even-minded book-length discussion of all the issues. Block (2008) responds on Stalnaker’s behalf to Edgington’s objections against his view. Douven (2011) and Gillies (2017) are introductory pieces — the latter discussing counterfactual as well as indicative conditionals.  </p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Does material implication provide a good analysis of indicative conditionals? (2016)</p>

<p>‘When A is true and B is false, “If A then B” is definitely false. Also, from “not-A or B” we can infer “If A then B”, which shows that whenever A is false or B is true, “If A then B” is true. This proves that the indicative conditional must be a truth- functional connective.’ Is that so? (2015)</p>

<p>Do conditionals have truth-conditions? (2014)</p>

<!--
Do indicative conditionals have truth-conditions?

Does the sentence ‘If Jill isn’t at home, then she is at the pub’ have the same truth- conditions as ‘Jill is either at home or at the pub’?-->

<!--
Stalnaker semantics: 
(1) Doesn't validate IE, i.e.:

'If A then, if B, C' not equivalent to 'If A and B, C'

McGee offers a modification that does validate IE, but it's not intuitive.

(2) Entails CONDITIONAL NON CONTRADICTION, i.e.:

Not both 'If A then B' and 'If A then not-B'

This prompts SLY PETE problem: Stalnaker conditionals have to be extremely context sensitive.

Sainsbury (2001) is an underappreciated gem, demonstrating the range of options available to formal semanticists aiming to accommodate Travis’s examples. The remaining papers all concede that truth-conditions are radically context-sensitive, though all except one argue that this can be accommodated within the framework of truth-conditional semantics that we’ve been working with over the past few weeks. The exception is Carston (2008), which offers a Relevance Theoretic perspective.  </p>

Kirkham (1992) is an accessible overview of various issues related to this week’s topic. Field (1972) influentially argues that Tarski’s theory aims (but fails) to provide a definition of truth that would acceptable to physicalists. McDowell (1978) is a response. Sher (1999) discusses both Field’s and other challenges to Tarski. Heck (1997) discusses the connection between Tarskian definitions of truth taken as, roughly, theories specifying the meanings of the sentences of the object-language and as theories of what ‘true’ means in the metalanguage. </p>

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘We can have no intuitions as to whether the term water has the same “reference” for Oscar and Twin Oscar: that is a matter of decision about the technical term “reference”.’ (CHOMSKY) Does this consideration undermine the force of Putnam’s Twin Earth thought experiment?

‘The Twin Earth thought experiment doesn't establish that meaning isn't in the head. At best it establishes that either meaning isn’t in the head, or meaning doesn’t determine reference.’ Is this correct?

Is there any sense according to which Oscar and Twin-Oscar mean the same thing when they say ‘Water is liquid’?

When you and your counterpart on twin earth use the word ‘water’, you refer to different chemical substances. Is there any good sense in which you use it with the same meaning?

‘Competent speakers know by reflection what their words mean. Certain words have their meaning because of speaker interaction with the environment. Thus, competent speakers can know by reflection about such interaction with the environment.’ Discuss.

Does your twin-earth counterpart use ‘water’ with the same meaning as you?

Do the semantics of adverbs have anything to tell us about ontological commitment?

What is the semantic contribution of adverbs?

## TRUTH
[TOP](#top)

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
Can we have a correspondence theory of truth without an accompanying metaphysics of facts?

Is the view that the meaning of a sentence is that sentence’s truth-conditions consistent with a deflationary theory of truth?

Are the correspondence theory of truth and the deflationary theory of truth really in tension?

What is deflationism about truth? Is it correct?

‘Truth is a device of semantic ascent.’ Discuss.

Can truth be defined?

If ‘It is true that Mary is tall’ has exactly the same truth-conditions as ‘Mary is tall’, what lessons can we draw from this concerning truth?
