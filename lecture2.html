<!--Our options:

- Deny that the argument is valid.
- Reject one or more of the premises.
- Accept the conclusion.

How to reject one or more premises:

- Reject the conclusion.
- Find some tension between the premises.
- Identify some particular premise as false.

<h1><!-- --></h1>
<p>G. E. Moore argues against the sceptic's first premise, the claim that you cannot know that you are not a BIV.</p>
<p>He thought you <em>can</em> know that you are not a BIV.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Moore's argument:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li class="fragment">You can know that you have hands.</li>
<li class="fragment">If you can know that you have hands, you can know that you are not a BIV.</li>
<li class="fragment">So, you can know that you are not a BIV.</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Moore's argument reverses the sceptic's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moore's second premise is equivalent to the sceptic's.</li>
<li>The sceptic employs <em>modus ponens</em> to infer that you cannot know you have hands.</li>
<li>Moore employs <em>modus tollens</em> to infer that you can know that you are not a BIV.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So whose first premise should we prefer?</p>
<ul>
<li>Moore: you can know that you have hands</li>
<li>Sceptic: you cannot know that you are not a BIV.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Maybe we are more <em>certain</em> of Moore's.</p>
<p>But why think this certainty is of any epistemological significance?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Compare Hume's observation, last week, that we are psychologically incapable of giving up our belief in the external world.</p>
<p>A natural reaction to this is, &quot;So what? How can that be epistemologically significant?&quot;</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The sceptic gives this argument for her premise:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>BRAIN IN A VAT</strong> is subjectively indistinguishable from how things are.</li>
<li>If a scenario is subjectively indistinguishable from how things are, you can't rule out the possibility that it obtains.</li>
<li>If you can't rule out the possibility that a scenario obtains, you cannot know that it does not obtain.</li>
<li>So, you cannot know that <strong>BRAIN IN A VAT</strong> does not obtain.</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Where does Moore think this goes wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Moore says that, while he cannot <em>prove</em> that the dreaming scenario does not obtain, he thinks that he nevertheless has conclusive evidence that it does not.</p></li>
<li><p>So he seems to deny the third claim, that to know that <strong>BRAIN IN A VAT</strong> does not obtain, one needs to be able to rule out the possibility that it does.</p></li>
</ul>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>One reason why Moore's response may seem unsatisfying: while he seems to reject the third claim, he gives us no explanation as to <strong>WHY</strong> it should be rejected.</p>
<p>(Compare Moore here with the reliablist, below.)</p>

<h1>KNOWLEDGE</h1>
<p>According to Nozick, S knows that P IFF</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is true that P</li>
<li>S believes that P</li>
<li>If P were false, S wouldn't believe that P</li>
<li>If P were true, S would believe that P</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>More briefly, S knows that P IFF S has a true belief that P which <strong>TRACKS THE TRUTH</strong>.</p>
<p>In meeting the third condition, S's belief that P is said to be <strong>SENSITIVE</strong>.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The third and fourth conditions are <strong>COUNTERFACTUALS</strong>.</p>
<p>To check whether they hold, we need to consider how things would be in certain possible situations.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>&quot;If I had dropped this glass, the water in it would have spilled&quot;</p>
<p>This seems true because in the <strong>CLOSEST</strong> possible situations in which I drop the glass (those most similar to the actual sitation), the water spills.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>It doesn't seem to matter that there are possible situations in which I drop the glass but the water does not spill - someone is hiding under the table, the water freezes.</p>
<p>Those situations are less close.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>More generally, it seems that a counterfactual holds IFF, in the closest possible situations in which the antecedent is true, the consequent is also true:</p>
<p>&quot;If it were the case that P, it would be the case that Q&quot;</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>In these terms, Nozick's view is that S knows that P IFF</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is true that P</li>
<li>S believes that P</li>
<li>In the closest possible situations in which P is false, S doesn't believe that P</li>
<li>In the closest possible situations in which P is true, S does believe that P.</li>
</ol>
</section><section id="scepticism" class="slide level2">
<h1>SCEPTICISM</h1>
<p>What's this got to do with the BIV argument?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Do you know the proposition that you are not a BIV (who is being deceived by a deranged scientist)?</p>
<p>Nozick: No. Even if you truly believe that you are not a BIV, you don't know it.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The closest possible situations in which it is false (in which you are a BIV) are ones in which, because you are being deceived, things seem to you to be the same as they actually seem. In those situations, you still believe that you are not a BIV.</p>
<p>So your belief is not sensitive.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Do you know the proposition that that you have hands?</p>
<p>Nozick: Yes, assuming that you truly believe that you have hands.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The closest possible situations in which it is false (in which you don't have hands) are ones in which, say, you have been in an industrial accident. In those situations, you don't believe that you have hands.</p>
<p>So Nozick's third condition is met. Your belief is sensitive.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>And the fourth condition? If the proposition that you have hands were true, would you have believed it?</p>
<p>The closest possible situation in which it is true (in which you do have hands) is the actual situation. In that situation, you believe that you have hands. So Nozick's fourth condition is met too.</p>
<p>So Nozick's fourth condition is met as well.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>According to Nozick, then, the sceptic's second premise is false: even though you don't (and in fact cannot) know that you are not a BIV, you can know that you have hands.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>We saw the sceptic's argument for this premise last week:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You know that the proposition that you have hands entails the proposition that you are not a BIV.</li>
<li>If you know that the proposition that you have hands entails the proposition that you are not a BIV, and you can know that you have hands, then you can know that you are not a BIV.</li>
<li>So, if you can know that you have hands, you can know that you are not a BIV.</li>
<li>So, if you cannot know that you are not a BIV, you cannot know that you have hands.</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<ul>
<li><p>Nozick accepts premise 1. (Homework: explain why!)</p></li>
<li><p>But he denies premise 2.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment">
<p>So Nozick thinks there are counterexamples to <strong>EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</strong>:</p>
<p>If you know that P entails Q, and you can know that P, then you can also know that Q.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Notice that, unlike Moore, Nozick explains not just where he thinks the sceptic's argument fails, but <strong>WHY</strong>. His account of knowledge is playing a crucial role.</p>
</section></section>
<section><section id="reliablism" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>RELIABLISM</h1></section><section id="section-2" class="slide level2">
<h1><!-- --></h1>
<p>According to reliablists, S knows that P IFF</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is true that P</li>
<li>S believes that P</li>
<li>S's belief was produced by a reliable process.</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Do you know the proposition that you have hands?</p>
<p>Reliablist: Yes, assuming that you truly believe that you have hands.</p>
<p>Your belief that you have hands is produced by a reliable process: perception.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Do you know the proposition that you are not a BIV?</p>
<p>Reliablist: Yes!</p>
<p>Your belief that you are not a BIV is produced by applying a reliable process, deductive inference, to your belief that you have hands, which is itself produced by a reliable process.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>According to reliablists, then, the sceptic's first premise is false: you <strong>CAN</strong> know that you are not a BIV.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Consider again the sceptic's argument for this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>BRAIN IN A VAT</strong> is subjectively indistinguishable from how things are.</li>
<li>If a scenario is subjectively indistinguishable from how things are, you can't rule out the possibility that it obtains.</li>
<li>If you can't rule out the possibility that a scenario obtains, you cannot know that it does not obtain.</li>
<li>So, you cannot know that <strong>BRAIN IN A VAT</strong> does not obtain.</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Like Moore, the reliablist rejects premise 3. To know that a sceptical scenario does not obtain, you do not need to be able to rule out the possibility that it does, i.e. prove that it does not.</p>
<p>But unlike Moore, the reliablist offers an explanation as to <strong>WHY</strong> premise 3 fails: an account of knowledge on which it requires only reliably produced true belief.</p>
</section></section>
<section><section id="externalism-v.-internalism" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>EXTERNALISM v. INTERNALISM</h1></section><section id="section-3" class="slide level2">
<h1><!-- --></h1>
<p>Here are two (connected) worries one might raise about Nozick's and the reliablist's responses to the sceptic.</p>
</section><section id="first-worry" class="slide level2">
<h1>FIRST WORRY</h1>
<p>In different ways, both Nozick and the reliablist argue that your belief that you have hands constitutes knowledge, <em>given the assumption that you have hands</em>.</p>
<p>Doesn't this beg the question against the sceptic?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>No. The sceptic doesn't deny that your belief that you have hands is <em>true</em>. She argues that it cannot constitute <em>knowledge</em>.</p>
<p>But if the reliablist's or Nozick's analyses of knowledge are correct, your belief that you have hands <em>can</em> constitute knowledge - and <em>does</em> constitute knowledge if it is true.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Another way of putting this: both Nozick and the reliablist try to show that it is possible that we <em>do</em> know that we have hands. But they try to do this without <em>proving</em> that we know we have hands.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So both Nozick and the reliablist allow for the possibility that we know that we have hands even if we do not know that we know that we hands.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So they both deny the <strong>KK PRINCIPLE</strong>:</p>
<p>One knows that P only if one knows that one knows that P.</p>
</section><section id="second-worry" class="slide level2">
<h1>SECOND WORRY</h1>
<p>On both Nozick's and the reliablist's analyses, whether S's true belief that P constitutes knowledge that P depends on factors that may be external to S's mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether S's belief is sensitive (Nozick),</li>
<li>or reliably produced (the reliabilist).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <strong>EXTERNALISM</strong> about knowledge.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>By contrast, consider: S knows that P IFF</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is true that P</li>
<li>S believes that P</li>
<li>S is able to produce an argument for P.</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>On this analysis, whether S's true belief that P constitutes knowledge that P depends only on factors that are internal to S's mind.</p>
<p>This is <strong>INTERNALISM</strong> about knowledge.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Laurence Bonjour raises a potential problem for externalism about knowledge:</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Norman, under certain conditions that usually obtain, is a completely reliable clairvoyant with respect to certain kinds of subject matter. He possesses no evidence or reasons of any kind for or against the general possibility of such a cognitive power, or for or against the thesis that he possesses it. One day Norman comes to believe that the President is in New York City, though he has no evidence either for or against this belief. In fact the belief is true and results from his clairvoyant power, under circumstances in which it is completely reliable.</p>
<p>Bonjour (1980) 'Externalist Theories of Empirical Knowledge', p. 62.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Norman's true belief is both sensitive and reliably produced.</p>
<p>But does Norman know that the President is in New York City?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>We might insist that Norman does know that the President is in New York City.</p>
<p>But what if we amend the case, and give Norman lots of evidence that he is not clairvoyant?</p>

<p>Moore's runs the sceptic's argument in reverse, and denies the sceptic's first premise, the claim that we cannot know that we are not BIVs.</p>
<p>If we are dissatisfied with Moore's response, that may be at least partly because he doesn't explain <strong>WHY</strong> the sceptic's argument fails.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Nozick denies the sceptic's second premise, the claim that we cannot know we have hands if we cannot know that we are not BIVs.</p>

<p>Reliablists deny the sceptic's first premise, the claim that we cannot know that we are not BIVs.</p>
