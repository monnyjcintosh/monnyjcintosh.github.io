<h1 id="philosophy-of-logic-and-language">Philosophy of Logic and Language</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for eight tutorials in Philosophy of Logic and Language. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="general-information">GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Before writing your essay, you should read <strong>all</strong> of the Core Reading for the topic unless otherwise indicated. (I’ve suggested a number of introductory readings for each topic. These are marked with a star: *. You needn’t read all of these. Pick whichever you find most useful.) Your essay and tutorial is only a first step towards an understanding of a topic, however. For finals, you will need to be able to answer any question that is set on around five topics, and you should use the Further Reading suggestions, in conjunction with the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/108%20Philosophy%20of%20Logic%20and%20Language.pdf">Faculty Reading list</a>, in vacations to work on the topics that most interest you.</p>

<p>Plan your essay out <strong>before</strong> you do any reading. That might seem back to front: you haven’t done any reading, so how can you plan out what you’ve got to say? But as soon as you know what the essay question is, you can form some idea of the questions you need to be thinking about, and these will structure both your essay, at least in a preliminary way, and your reading. You can, and most likely will, revise your essay plan as you do the reading.</p>

<p>In addition to an essay, you should also be compiling notes, stating the main positions or puzzles relating to the week’s topic, with bullet points summarising their pros and cons. You should revise and supplement these notes after the tutorial and as you read and attend lectures on the subject over the rest of your time in Oxford. They are much more important than your essay. Your essay is a snapshot of your understanding of the topic at a particular time, taken from the particular angle determined by the essay question. In your exams, your answers will be snapshots of a much deeper understanding taken from a different angle - they will be answers to different questions! Your notes should be improving with your understanding.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="course-plan">COURSE PLAN</h2>
<p>The default plan is to cover the topics listed as <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. These cover a wide range of issues in the philosophy of language, loosely organised around the idea that innovations in the subject have drawn on innovations in philosophical logic. I am happy to accommodate other interests, however. Students with particular interests in logic may prefer to cover some or all of the topics listed under <strong>PHILOSOPHY OF LOGIC</strong>, while students with particular interests in philosophical accounts of meaning may wish to cover some or all of the topics listed under <strong>MEANING</strong>. Miscellaneous other topics that students may wish to cover are listed under <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. If there is a topic in the philosophy of logic or language that doesn’t appear on any of these lists and that you would like to cover, let me know.</p>

<h2 id="textbooks-and-anthologies">TEXTBOOKS and ANTHOLOGIES</h2>

<p><strong>TEXTBOOKS</strong><br />
There is no set textbook, but I have suggested introductory readings from the following:</p>

<p>Michael Morris (2007) <em>An Introduction to the Philosophy of Language</em> (CUP).  <br />
William Lycan (2008) <em>Philosophy of Language: A Contemporary Introduction</em> (Routledge, 2nd edition).<br />

<p>Other useful textbooks include Paul Elbourne’s <em>Meaning</em> (OUP, 2011) and Alexander Miller’s (2007) <em>Philosophy of Language</em> (Routledge, 2nd edition). If you are planning on studying any of the <strong>PHILOSOPHY OF LOGIC</strong> topics, the following textbooks are also recommended:</p>

<p>Jennifer Fisher (2008) <em>On the Philosophy of Logic</em> (Wadsworth).<br />
Stephen Read (1995) <em>Thinking About Logic</em> (OUP).<br />
Mark Sainsbury (2000) <em>Logical Forms</em> (Blackwell, 2nd edition).  </p>

<p>The following are a bit more advanced, but will prove very useful for consolidating what you have learnt after the end of term:</p>

<p>Jason Stanley (2008) ‘Philosophy of Language’ in D. Moran, ed. <em>The Routledge Companion to Twentieth Century Philosophy</em> (Routledge).<br />
Scott Soames (2010) <em>Philosophy of Language</em> (Princeton).  </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Kripke (1977) is a must-read, defending a broadly Russellian position. Neale (1990) is a classic exposition and defence of Kripke’s position. The analysis of definite descriptions has become a key battleground in debates over the semantics/pragmatics distinction. For two essential reads here, see Recanati (1993) and Stanley and Szabó (2000). See also the response to Stanley and Szabó from Neale and Bach in the same issue. It is probably fair to say that, in contemporary work, linguists have preferred a Strawsonian approach to definite descriptions. For an influential discussion, see von Fintel (2004).</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Do proper names have a sense as well as a reference?</p>

<p>If the meaning of a name is simply its referent, then what is the meaning of an empty name, such as ‘Santa Claus’?</p>

<p>Are there any reasons to think that the meaning of a proper name cannot be given by a rigidified definite description such as ‘The actual teacher of Alexander’?</p>

<!--Suppose that twins Sarah and Lisa are accidentally swapped as babies after their parents have named them both. Unbeknowst to anyone, the child originally named 'Sarah' grows up being called 'Lisa' and the child originally named 'Lisa' grows up being called 'Sarah'. Must the causal theory of reference predict that 'Sarah' refers to the child everyone calls 'Lisa' and vice versa?

What role, if any, do causal relations play in determining the referents of proper names?

Dummett (1975) and McDowell (1977) are sympathetic (and contrasting) discussions of Frege's distinction, both helpfully setting the issues in the broader context of thinking about theories of meaning. They're both fairly hard going, however, and perhaps best left till after the end of term. Braun (1993) and Thomasson (2003) defend accounts of the apparent meaningfulness of, respectively, empty and fictional names. On empty names, Ch. 2 and 3 of Sainsbury (2005), above, are also essential.

Kirkham (1992) is an accessible overview of various issues related to this week’s topic.
