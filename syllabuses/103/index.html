<h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Ethics. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with occasional <strong><em>FURTHER</em> FURTHER READING</strong>, and more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/103%20Ethics%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the following <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. The first five weeks look at various debates in the early modern period, focusing on Hobbes, Moral Rationalism, and, especially, Hume and Kant, as well as what is in some ways the fundamental issue between the latter two, Free Will. We then spend a couple of weeks on two of the main positions in contemporary normative ethics, Consequentialism and Contractualism. With all this in mind, we turn in the final week to contemporary metaethics, and the question of Moral Realism. I will at some point provide essay questions and readings for some <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong> too, which students may wish to pursue in their own time.</p>

<p>I’ve had advice from various friends in putting together this reading list and its previous incarnation, and am particularly grateful to Chris Jay, Nadine Elzein, Stefan Sienkiewicz, Tom Sinclair, and Ed Lamb. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of it at all, as occasional emails suggest some people do, please feel free.</p>

<h4 id="anthologies-and-textbooks">ANTHOLOGIES and TEXTBOOKS</h4>

<p>There are no set texts for this paper, but we will mainly be focusing on early modern debates, and particularly on Hume and Kant. The key works are Hume’s <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em> (1738/1740) and Kant’s <em>Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals</em> (1785). You should pick up copies of these and read them beforehand. (Any scholarly edition of each will do. I have the Oxford Philosophical Texts edition of the Hume and the Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy edition of the Kant.) The order and choice of topics is loosely based on David Wiggins’ excellent <em>Ethics: Twelve Lectures on the Philosophy of Morality</em> (Penguin, 2006). Chapters of this are suggested in connection with certain topics below, and you might find it helpful to read it through in looking back over the material for revision. </p>

<p>For more introductory discussion, suitable for reading over the vacation beforehand, try either of the following, which I refer to below as <strong>Darwall</strong> and <strong>Driver</strong> respectively:</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The question <em>why should I be moral?</em> will remain with us over the course of the term, and you ought to reflect on how the different philosophers we’ll be looking at—Hume, Kant, consequentialists, and contractualists—might answer it. Korsgaard (1996b) is a useful guide, and an excellent place to start in looking into the topic in more depth. Lecture 1 discusses the approaches of voluntarists like Hobbes and rationalists like Prichard. Lecture 2 looks at Humean, neo-Humean, and utilitarian approaches. Lectures 3 and 4 develop a Kantian approach. Hills (2010) is another good book-length treatment of the topic, and includes discussion of Korsgaard. </p>

<p>Various other contemporary discussions are well worth looking at too. Williams (1973) offers a neo-Humean response to the amoralist. McDowell (1978) is a response to Foot (1972). (Foot herself changed her view. See, in the first instance, the ‘Recantation’ in Stephen Darwall, Allan Gibbard, and Peter Railton, eds. (1997) <i>Moral Discourse and Practice: Some Philosophical Approaches</i> (OUP).) Hooker (1997) argues that various attempts to show that moral virtue constitutes a benefit to the agent fail. Raz (1999) tries to defuse arguments to the effect that morality and self-interest are opposed. For more contemporary discussion of egoism, see Elliot Sober’s paper in <strong>LF&amp;P</strong> and Kurt Baier’s in <strong>Singer</strong>. You’ll also find various other good, relevant discussions in Part I of <strong>SL</strong> and Section I of <strong>Sher</strong>. </p>

<h4 id="further-further-reading"><em>FURTHER</em> FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>I set Hobbes and Prichard as core reading this week partly to introduce you to an extended debate among British philosophers over the foundations of morality. Hobbes can be thought of as making the first contribution to this debate, and his views were often a target for subsequent writers. His voluntarism, the view that morality depends on the will of an authority, was criticised by moral rationalists, such as Samuel Clarke and William Wollaston. Prichard, though he was writing much later than Clarke and Wollaston, belongs to the same rationalist tradition. A third camp, the so-called moral sense theorists such as the Earl of Shaftesbury, Francis Hutcheson, and David Hume, criticised both moral rationalism and the egoism that they took Hobbes to endorse—though it was a populariser of Hobbes’ ideas, Bernard Mandeville, that was as often as not the focus of their attacks. In this latter task they were joined by Joseph Butler, the bishop of Durham, who stood midway between rationalism and moral sentimentalism. We’ll look at Hume’s attack on rationalism, as well as his moral sentimentalism, next week, but you might find it helpful in thinking about this week’s topic to look more closely at these early modern debates. You can find the primary sources in <strong>Raphael</strong>, but Mackie (1980) is probably the best place to start. Beyond that, you will find good introductory discussion of Hobbes in <strong>Darwall</strong>, and an excellent discussion of Joseph Butler in Ralph Wedgwood’s contribution to Bloomfield (2008), which contains various other useful papers on this week’s topic. </p>

<p>How much turns on the possibility of persuading the amoralist to be moral? (2016)</p>

<p>‘[I]n all ingenuous natures, the antipathy to treachery and roguery is too strong to be counter-balanced by any views of profit or pecuniary advantage. Inward peace of mind, consciousness of integrity, a satisfactory review of our own conduct; these are circumstances, very requisite to happiness, and will be cherished and cultivated by every honest man, who feels the importance of them.’ (HUME) How good a response is this to the amoralist?

Various editions, inc. Oxford Philosophical Texts edition, ed. by David Fate Norton and Mary J. Norton (OUP, 2000). Reprinted in <b>Raphael</b>.</p>

</div>

<p>The important thing this week is to get a sense of the primary reading, and I would rather you focused on that, using Cohon’s article as a guide to the issues. But if you want to look at some of the secondary literature, start with: </p>

<div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;">

<p>*J. L. Mackie (1980) <i><a href="http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/oxford/detail.action?docID=179478">Hume's Moral Theory</a></i> (Routledge), esp. Ch. III to VII.</p>

</div>

<p>If you plan on studying Hume’s ethics in depth, Mackie’s book is essential reading. It’s  intended as an introduction to some of the main problems of moral philosophy, rather than as a contribution to Hume scholarship, but it’s an excellent way into Hume’s ethics, as well as the early modern debates that began with Thomas Hobbes.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>If you decide to pursue this topic further, the main issues to think about are (a) Hume’s account of motivation, and his criticisms of moral rationalism; (b) the role of sympathy and the common point of view in his account of moral judgement; and (c) his account of justice and promise keeping. While Hume’s <em>Treatise</em> is the main primary text, you should also look at the later <em>An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</em>, in which Hume presents things rather differently. (Among other things, this is where Hume’s criticisms of egoism are to be found. See especially Appendix 2.) You should also look at certain of his essays—particularly ‘<a href="https://davidhume.org/texts/empl/1/sc">The Sceptic</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://davidhume.org/texts/empl/1/st">Of the Standard of Taste</a>’. </p>

<p>Baillie (2000) is a good book-length introduction to Hume’s ethics. Cohon (2008) is more advanced, but a great corrective to various interpretative misunderstandings.

<p>How, in Kant’s view, must an action be motivated in order for it to have “moral worth”? Is he right?</p>

<p>Kant is not an easy read, and even the relatively short <em>Groundwork</em> is best approached over several tutorials. Allen Wood, a leading interpreter of Kant, <a href="https://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2012/10/allen-wood-on-ethics-1-kant-and-mutual-respect.html">has said</a> that the first fifty times he read it he didn’t understand it at all! We will look at Section I this week, and a central feature of Section II the next. Good overviews of Kant’s ethics include Thomas Hill Jr.’s article in <strong>LF&amp;P</strong>, Onora O’Neill’s in <strong>Singer</strong>, J. David Velleman’s in <strong>Sher</strong>, Ch. 5 of <strong>Driver</strong>, and:</p>

<p>Part I of Baron (1995) addresses the worry—raised by Wolf (1982) (pardon the pun)—that Kant’s emphasis on duty leaves no room for <em>supererogatory</em> actions, actions that go beyond the call of duty. Part II addresses the worry—raised by Stocker (1976) and Williams (1976)—that it leaves no room for motives like love and friendship. Arpaly (2003), discussing the case of Huckleberry Finn, argues that moral worth is a matter of acting for moral reasons, regardless of whether or not the agent recognises them as such. Sliwa (2016) is a recent response to this view.</p>

<p>The 1970s and 80s saw a resurgence of interest in Kant’s ethics, largely due to the work of John Rawls and his students, Herman, Korsgaard, and O’Neill. Rawls’ Harvard lectures on Kant’s ethics can be found in his (2000) book, which I also recommended as Further Reading on Hume’s ethics last week. Kant I is the lecture of most relevance to this week’s topic, and Kant II to next week’s, but all of his lectures on Kant are recommended.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between subsidiary moral principles (such as prohibitions on lying and suicide) and the “universal law” version of Kant’s categorical imperative?

<p>O’Neill (1985) and Herman (1985) are two influential pieces on universalizability. O’Neill argues that, properly understood, Kantian universalization yields substantive constraints on action, while Herman argues its use in moral deliberation presupposes knowledge of rules that guide the agent in the perception of morally relevant features of the circumstances in which the agent acts, and goes on to argue that this helps address various criticisms that have been pressed against Kantian approaches. Wood (1999) is a lively attempt to undermine what Wood takes to be the caricature of Kant as a rule fetishist offering a system that amounts to little more than an “ethical sausage-machine” for outputting right actions. Ch. 3 focuses on the Formula of Universal Law, arguing that Kant’s other formulations of the Categorical Imperative play a more fundamental role in his thinking, and discussing Herman, Korsgaard, and O’Neill in the process. Kleingeld (2017) is a more recent piece, stressing the significance of the fact that the Formula of Universal Law requires one to act on maxims that one can <em>simultaneously</em> will as universal laws.</p>

<p>You’ll find the rest of both Part One of Korsgaard (1996a) and Part I of Wood (1999)—as well as the Kant lectures in Rawls (2000), suggested in last week’s Further Reading—helpful in thinking about Kant’s other formulations of the Categorical Imperative, the Formula of Humanity as End-in-Itself and the Formula of Autonomy. Other good pieces on universalizability, as it figures either in Kant or in ethics more generally, include Mackie (1977), Williams (1985), and Wiggins (1987). Wiggins (2006) is the text on which our choice of topics is based, and Ch. 4 focuses on Kant.</p>

<h4 id="further-further-reading-2"><em>FURTHER</em> FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>You might want to think about Section III of the <em>Groundwork</em>. It’s notoriously difficult, and there’s no <em>need</em> to work on it, but it’s where you’ll find Kant’s answer to the question, <em>why should I be moral?</em>, so it will help if you’re thinking about Week 1’s topic in more detail. It also raises questions about Kant’s conception of free will, so will help with next week’s too. And even if you’re not pursuing either of those topics any further, if you’re working on either last week’s or this week’s topic in more depth, it will obviously be helpful to have a good understanding of how the whole text works. There’s some introductory discussion—within the context of a more general discussion of the question, <em>why be moral?</em>—of what’s often taken to be Kant’s strategy, and its failings, in Singer (2011). Allison (1990) also discusses its failings, and argues that Kant had something better to offer. Also see Hill Jr. (1989), Korsgaard (1989b), O’Neill (1989), and Korsgaard (1996b)—which I also suggested as Further Reading for Week 1. </p>

<p>The further literature on this week’s topic is vast. With that, however, there is also a mass of introductory literature. You’ll find very brief introductions to the relevant sections of <strong>SL</strong> and <strong>Sher</strong>; John Martin Fischer’s piece in <strong>Copp</strong> is more detailed, focused mainly on van Inwagen (1975) and Frankfurt (1969); Gary Watson’s ‘Introduction’ to <strong>Watson</strong> is extremely helpful, offering a great overview of the issues; and you’ll find several useful entries in the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia</em>—the Related Entries section of McKenna and Coates (2004/15), listed above, provides links. If you want a good book on the topic, aimed at advanced undergraduates, then try McKenna and Pereboom (2016). </p>

<div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;">

<p>*Michael McKenna and Derk Pereboom (2016) <i>Free Will: A Contemporary Introduction</i> (Routledge).</p>

</div>

<p>In pursuing the topic in depth, you’ll want to think a bit more about van Inwagen’s consequence argument. The main thing to look at here is Lewis (1981), to which van Inwagen responds in his (2004). You’ll also want to think a bit more about Frankfurt’s challenge to the Principle of Alternate Possibilities and Peter Strawson’s account of moral responsibility in terms of reactive attitudes. To that end, Widerker and McKenna (2006) and McKenna and Russell (2008) are useful collections of articles, the former focused on Frankfurt and the latter on Strawson. But the main thing to do is familiarise yourself with contemporary libertarian, compatibilist, and sceptical approaches to free will and moral responsibility. See, in the first place, Chisholm (1964), Frankfurt (1971), Wolf (1987), and Strawson (1994). Then go on and look at the other papers in <b>Watson</b>, using the introductory literature above as your guide. </p>

<p>This week’s topic serves as a bridge between the first four weeks, where we looked at Hume and Kant, and the question of the status of morality was more prominent, and the next two weeks, where we’ll look at some issues in contemporary normative ethics, and the question of the content of morality will come to the fore. For on the one hand, questions concerning the metaphysics of free will lie at the heart of the debate between Hume and Kant. On the other hand, questions concerning the nature of moral responsibility lie at the heart of the debate between consequentialists and their opponents. You might want to think about these issues. For the debate between Hume and Kant, see the next chapter in the story as told by Wiggins (2006). For the connection with debates between consequentialists and their opponents, see Ingmar Persson’s contribution to <strong>LF&amp;P</strong>. Past papers sometimes contain questions on moral luck, a topic which also relates to Kant. If you’re interested in pursuing this topic, start with the debate between Bernard Williams (1976) and Tom Nagel (1976). Nelkin (2004/13) is a survey of subsequent work. </p>

<p>Many of you will be familiar with consequentialism from your first year study of Mill’s <em>Utilitarianism</em>, but in case you aren’t, there are various introductory pieces that will help you get up to speed. See, for example, the chapters on Mill in <strong>Darwall</strong>, chapters 3 and 4 of <strong>Driver</strong>, Pettit’s contribution to <strong>Singer</strong>, Brink’s to <strong>Copp</strong>, and the following:</p>

<p>In working on this topic in more depth, you’ll want to get a sense of the range of objections that have been pressed against consequentialism. The Core Reading focuses on the objection that it is too <em>demanding</em>, requiring agents to devote their resources to performing actions that, however admirable, are not intuitively obligatory, and that leave them with no time or energy for their own interests, as well as the related objection that it alienates agents from the projects and purposes that provide their lives with the sort of <em>integrity</em>, or unity, that, in Bernard Williams’ view, makes agency possible in the first place. Other influential objections include that of Rawls (1971), who argues that, in ignoring questions of distribution across different people’s lives, consequentialism ignores the <em>separateness</em> of persons, as well as those of deontologists, such as Thomson (1985), who argue that consequentialism is too <em>permissive</em>, allowing—and, indeed, requiring—agents to perform actions that common-sense morality forbids.</p>

<p>Your main task will be to get a handle on how consequentialists have responded, especially to the demandingness objection. One strategy is to argue that it is not unreasonable for a morality to make the sorts of extreme demands that consequentialism is alleged to make. This is the strategy pursued by Singer (1972) in the Core Reading. It’s also the strategy pursued by Kagan (1989), a particularly influential book, which is well worth prioritising in further study of this week’s topic. And Ashford (2000) pursues a similar line in response to Williams’ integrity objection. §2.1 of Mulgan (2001) critically discusses this strategy, which, following Kagan, he calls <em>extremism</em>. Cullity (1994) is a response to Singer (1972). Another strategy is to deny that consequentialism gives rise to extreme demands in the first place. Jackson (1991) is an influential attempt to pursue this strategy, arguing that, since we can be more certain of maximizing utility if we focus our efforts on those closest to us, consequentialism does not require us to make the sorts of great personal sacrifice that its opponents sometimes claim. See §2.2 of Mulgan (2001) for critical discussion. Perhaps the most common strategy, however, is to argue that potential conflict with common-sense morality can be addressed by some <em>variant</em> of consequentialism. Scheffler (1982) and Railton (1984), in the Core Reading, are instances of this strategy, arguing that conflicts can be addressed by, respectively, hybrid or indirect forms of consequentialism. Kagan (1989) discusses Scheffler (see esp. Ch. 1 and 7), while Mason (1998) defends Railton. Hooker’s contribution to <strong>LF&amp;P</strong> pursues this strategy too, arguing that rule-consequentialism addresses the worry, while Norcross (2006) argues for a radical, <em>scalar approach</em>. For critical discussion of the strategy, see Mulgan (2001), starting with §2.3. Sobel (2007) takes a different line altogether, arguing that the demandingness objection depends for its force on prior non-consequentialist conclusions that need to be independently motivated.</p>

<p>While you may already be familiar with Mill’s contribution to consequentialist thought, you might want to look at the contributions of others, such as Jeremy Bentham, Henry Sidgwick, G. E. Moore, and R. M. Hare. Sidgwick (1907) is especially relevant to this week’s essay topic, discussing the relationship between utilitarianism and common-sense morality at length. It’s also of particular relevance if you’re thinking about consequentialist treatments of Week 1’s topic, the question, <em>why should I be moral?</em> For discussion of Sidgwick’s views on this week’s topic, see Lazari-Radek and Singer (2014), especially Ch. 5, 10, and 11. For discussion of his views on the question, <em>why should I be moral?</em>, see Parfit (2011) and Ch. 6 of Lazari-Radek and Singer (2014). Wiggins (2006) continues the narrative of the course, critically assessing various arguments for consequentialism, including arguments from Hare and Scheffler.</p>

<p>There’s rather less by way of introductory reading for this week’s topic but, in addition to Southwood (2009), try Phillip Stratton-Lake’s ‘Introduction’ to <b>Stratton-Lake</b> and this article in the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>:</p>

<div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;">

<p>
*Elizabeth Ashford and Tim Mulgan (2007/18) 'Contractualism' in Edward Zalta, ed. <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> (Fall 2018 edition): <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/contractualism/">https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/contractualism/</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>In pursuing this topic in more depth, start by getting clear on what exactly the view is. It’s useful here to think about the objection that Scanlon’s contractualism is explanatorily redundant. Stratton-Lake (2003) explains why initial formulations of this objection were based on a misunderstanding, argues that the objection nevertheless re-emerges, and then goes on to offer a solution. Read that, and then read Ridge (2003), which argues that Scanlon cannot avail himself of Stratton-Lake’s solution to the “new and improved” redundancy objection without giving up some of his central commitments, but that contractualism’s not vulnerable to the objection in the first place.  </p>

</div>

<p>Next, think about the appeal of Scanlon’s contractualism, which lies in large part in its promise of accounts that are superior to those of its rivals of both the content and status of a central core of morality. The debate in the secondary literature debate has focused mainly on the contractualist account of the content of morality, and particularly on whether it offers an adequate response to worries about demandingness, aggregation, and risk. Hills (2010) is a response to Ashford’s treatment of the first question, concerning demandingness, while Scanlon (2003) includes discussion of Derek Parfit’s treatment of the second, concerning aggregation. On this issue, see also Otsuka (2006), Rahul Kumar’s contribution to Wallace, Kumar, and Freeman (2011), Parfit (2011), and Scanlon (2011), which replies to Parfit. For discussion of the the third question, concerning risk, see Frick (2015) and Horton (2017). In thinking about the topic in depth, however, you will also want to think about the contractualist account of the status of morality. In doing so, it’s helpful to think about the contrast between the way Scanlon presents his contractualism in <em>What We Owe to Each Other</em> and his earlier, (1982) paper. Wallace (2002), in the Core Reading, is helpful too, as are Southwood (2010) and Pamela Hieronymi’s contribution to Wallace, Kumar, and Freeman (2011).  </p>

<p>Moral realism comes in either of two varieties. Put crudely, <em>moral naturalism</em> is the view that moral properties are natural properties, while <em>moral non-naturalism</em> is the view that they are non-natural properties. For a long time, Moore’s (1903) open question argument was taken to show that moral properties had to be <em>sui generis</em>, non-natural properties, and so to show that non-naturalism was the only option for moral realists. Yet non-natural properties seem to be metaphysically dubious, or “queer”, as Mackie put it, and it’s difficult to see how we might provide a plausible account of how we can come to know about them. Many theorists therefore chose to reject moral realism altogether. Developments in the philosophy of language and mind led to a rethink, however, and the 1980s saw a resurgence of interest in moral naturalism, largely due to the work of the so-called <em>Cornell realists</em>, Boyd, Brink, Railton, and Sturgeon. See Lutz and Lenman (2006/18) for an overview, and think especially about the Moral Twin Earth objection to Cornell realism. Then try Sturgeon (1985), Brink (1989), and Jackson (1998)—the last the most prominent defender of the so-called <em>Canberra Plan</em>. More recently, there’s been a recent resurgence of interest in non-naturalism. See Ridge (2003/14) for an overview, and think especially about the supervenience problem. Then try McDowell (1985), a classic discussion of Mackie, and Shafer-Landau (2003) and Enoch (2011), two highlights of the recent revival. For a discussion and defence of Mackie’s argument(s) from queerness, see Olson (2014).</p>

<p>Supposing that utilitarianism is true, could we find out that utilitarianism is true in the same kind of way scientists found out that water is H<sub>2</sub>O? (2017)</p>

<p>‘There is no version of metaethical moral realism that can combine both metaphysical and epistemological plausibility, and so the realist project should be abandoned.’ Discuss. (2016)  </p>

<p>‘The way the moral properties are distributed in a world cannot change without some natural properties changing. Therefore it is implausible to hold that moral properties are sui generis non-natural properties.’ Is this a good argument against non-naturalist moral realism? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) How worried should a moral realist be by the fact that there is no science of
ethics?<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration:line-through">(b) Are moral intuitions evidence of truth in ethics?</span> (2014)</p>

<!--**EITHER**  
(a) ‘Mixed normative facts [such as the fact that a particular consideration is a reason] depend on non-normative facts, and which non-normative facts they depend on is a normative matter, determined by the truth of pure normative claims. The truth of pure normative claims...does not depend on, or co-vary with, non-normative facts.’ (SCANLON) Does this solve the metaethical problem of supervenience for realists?  
**OR**  
(b) ‘We begin as (tacit) cognitivists and realists about ethics. ... Moral Realism should be our metaethical starting point, and we should give it up only if it does involve unacceptable metaphysical and epistemological commitments.’ (BRINK) Discuss. (2018) -->
