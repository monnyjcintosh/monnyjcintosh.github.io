<h1 id="philosophy-of-mathematics">Philosophy of Mathematics</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Mathematics. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/79059/files/2381486?wrap=1">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. There are also (or will eventually be) some <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>, which I’ll provide reading lists for as and when I get some time to do so. In setting the essay questions and readings for the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, I’ve taken as a point of departure James Studd’s reading list, which you can find on <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/oxford/lists/01584A08-BB0A-1AEB-D349-5287AD78285A.html">Talis</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>I have set chapters from Bostock (2009) and Shapiro (2000) as introductory Core Reading, while Hamkins (2021) is the text on which the lectures (and, in recent years, many of the exam questions) are based. Any would serve well as vacation reading, ideally alongside Alexander George and Daniel Velleman (2002) <i>Philosophies of Mathematics</i> (Blackwell), which treats the first three topics in a little more depth. You’ll also find good overviews of the topics we’ll be looking at in the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>. The following is a good place to start—you’ll find links to other relevant entries at the bottom of the article:</p>

<div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;">

Two other textbooks, although less directly keyed to our topics, are well worth a look:

<div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;">

</p>

</div>

Colyvan (2011) covers some of the material we'll be looking at&mdash;it's particularly useful in thinking about nominalism, fictionalism, and indispensability arguments, and I've suggested some chapters from it in connection with week 6. Hamkins (2021) covers much the same ground as his faculty lectures, albeit in a bit more depth. Since the lectures provide the basis of many of the exam questions, you would do well to familiarise yourself with the book. I'd recommend that you work through the chapters, and the accompanying exercises, in the vacation immediately following your tutorials for this paper.-->

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In theory, questions on Frege’s and Russell’s views in the philosophy of mathematics, which used to be set for the old <em>Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein</em> paper, are now set for this one, but in practice this doesn’t seem to happen, so it’s perhaps best to regard this topic as preparatory for future weeks. In pursuing it in more depth, you might want to start with Ch. 2 and 3 of George and Velleman (2002), which cover much the same material as Bostock in the Core Reading, but in a little more detail; Ch. 3, among other things, explains how to derive Peano’s axioms of arithmetic in ZF via the von Neumann ordinals. See also Burgess (2005) and Demopoulos and Clark’s contribution to <strong>Shapiro</strong>. For further discussion of Frege, see Dummett (1991) and various papers in Demopoulos, ed. (1995), starting perhaps with those by Benacerraf and Parsons. We’ll look at attempts to rescuscitate something like Frege’s program when we look at <a href="#neo-logicism"><strong>NEO-LOGICISM</strong></a> in week 8. For further discussion of Russell’s philosophy of mathematics, see, in the first instance, Sainsbury (1979). You can focus for now on Russell’s so-called <em>simple</em> theory of types—see Copi (1971) and Urquart’s paper in Griffin, ed. (2003). For the <em>ramified</em> theory, see the readings for the <strong>PREDICATIVISM</strong>. You might also want to think about the question whether second-order logic is really logic. For more on this, see Shapiro’s own contribution to <strong>Shapiro</strong>, as well as the reading for the <a href="http:jonnymcintosh.com/syllabuses/127/#sol"><strong>SECOND-ORDER LOGIC</strong></a> topic in the <a href="http:jonnymcintosh.com/syllabuses/127/"><strong>PHILOSOPHICAL LOGIC</strong></a> paper.</p>

<!--You might also want to think about the question whether second-order logic is really logic. For more on this, see, in the first instance, Shapiro's own contribution to **Shapiro**. Beyond that, look at the suggestions in the entry for **SECOND-ORDER LOGIC** for **PHILOSOPHICAL LOGIC**. We'll look at contemporary work on the issue when we do [**NEO-LOGICISM**](#neo-logicism); in the meantime, you might want to look at Rayo's contribution to Shapiro for some general discussion of the prospects for logicism.-->

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p><strong>Benacerraf and Putnam</strong> contains various pieces by Brouwer and Heyting. For overviews, see Posy in <strong>Shapiro</strong> and van Stigt’s introduction to Part I of Mancosu, ed. (1998). Your time’s probably best spent focusing on Dummett, however. His (1978) reprints ‘The Philosophical Significance of Intuitionistic Logic’ alongside various other important papers; see especially ‘Wang’s Paradox’ and (looking ahead to next week) ‘The Philosophical Significance of Gödel’s Theorem’. But perhaps the most important thing to read is his (2000) book, updating the first edition, published in 1977; see especially the introduction, Ch. 1 and Ch. 7, but also Ch. 2 and 3, on intuitionistic mathematics. George and Velleman (2002) is, again, an invaluable discussion. Ch. 4 focuses on the differences between intuitionism and realism; Ch. 5 on intuitionistic mathematics. For some additional critical discussion, you might try Hellman (1989) and Rumfitt (2000), as well as Cook’s piece in <strong>Shapiro</strong>. For a nice overview of intuitionistic logic, try Burgess (2009), while, for more on intuitionism in contemporary mathematics, try McCarty’s contribution to <strong>Shapiro</strong>.</p>

<p>As ever, George and Velleman (2002) is well worth a look; Ch. 6 and 7 cover much the same ground as Bostock in the Core Reading, but in more depth. See also the excellent discussion in Potter (2000), and the historical overview of formalisms of all sorts in Detlefsen’s paper in <strong>Shapiro</strong>. Of the primary literature, perhaps the most useful thing to look at is Hilbert (1928). See also Part III of Mancosu, ed. (1998), including the useful introduction by Mancosu himself, placing Hilbert’s program within the context of debates about intuitionism.  Blanchette (1996) discusses Hilbert’s early views, and his debate with Frege on the significance of consistency. Detlefsen (1986) attempts to defend Hilbert’s program in the face of Gödel’s results. Despite this, the program is generally regarded a failure—Giaquinto, in the Core Reading, is the best discussion I know of. But less ambitious programs remain. Simpson (2009) is an introduction to one of these: <em>reverse mathematics</em>, pioneered by Harvey Friedman.</p>

<p>In thinking more about this topic, start with debate concerning the iterative conception. How is it to be understood? Why think it’s correct? Which axioms of ZFC are justified on it? In particular, does it sanction Replacement or Choice? In approaching these questions, you could do worse than work through Incurvati (2020), a recent and accessible discussion of the iterative and other conceptions of set. The iterative conception itself goes back to Zermelo and von Neumann, but was first made explicit by Gödel; see his ‘What is Cantor’s Continuum Problem?’ in <strong>Benacerraf and Putnam</strong>. See the epilogue to Ferreirós (2007) for more on the history, and, for some other classic discussions, Gödel’s ‘Russell’s Mathematical Logic’ and the pieces by Parsons and Wang in <strong>Benacerraf and Putnam</strong>. Other, more recent discussions include Maddy (1988), Potter (1993), and Linnebo (2013).  <!--Potter (2004) is a another useful book on the issues, intertwining an introduction to set theory with philosophical discussion, e.g. of the significance of the set-theoretic reduction of pure mathematics. -->Further questions emerge in connection with the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). Owing to work by Gödel and Cohen, we know that both CH and ¬CH are consistent with ZFC. So how, if at all, is the question of whether or not CH is true to be settled? How might additional axioms that settle it be motivated? Should we think of there being such a thing as a determinate set-theoretic reality in which CH holds or doesn’t in the first place? Is there rather a plurality of set-theoretic universes, in some of which CH holds and in others of which it doesn’t? The issues here are technical, but rewarding. Ch. 12 of Linnebo (2017), listed in the Core Reading, provides a short introduction, though Ch. 8 of Hamkins (2021), conveying some of the richness and depth of the issues, is perhaps a better place to start. See also Maddy (2017), examining how set theory provides a foundation for mathematics.</p>

<p>Field (1989) develops and defends his fictionalist response. It includes, among other things, his response to an interesting objection raised in Shapiro (1983), who argues that Field’s program faces problems analogous to those posed by Gödel for Hilbert’s program. More recent critical discussions of Field include Macbride (1999) and Burgess and Rosen (1997), which is essential reading for anyone interested in nominalism more generally—though you might want to start with their contribution to <strong>Shapiro</strong>, a short paper in which they set out what they take to be the central challenges to nominalism. See also Chihara’s contribution, which defends his own variety of nominalism from their objections.

<h4 id="further-reading-6">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Structuralist ideas go back to Dedekind (1888), though they first emerged in English-speaking philosophy of mathematics in the 1960s with Benacerraf’s ‘What Numbers Could Not Be’ and Putnam’s ‘Mathematics without Foundations’. If you’re pursuing this topic in more depth, you’ll want to read all three. (Putnam’s paper, like Benacerraf’s, is in <strong>Benacerraf and Putnam</strong>.) Benacerraf and Putnam both attacked set-theoretic reductionism—something which, by now, you will no doubt have a good handle on, but see Ch. 3 of George and Velleman, listed as Further Reading for <a href="#logicism"><strong>FREGE’S and RUSSELL’S LOGICISMS</strong></a>, for a refresher. The 1980s saw further developments, with Hellman, drawing on Putnam, developing a form of eliminative structuralism and Resnik and Shapiro, drawing more on Benacerraf, developing forms of non-eliminative structuralism. You’ll want to work through the differences between these; see, in addition to the pieces by Hellman and Shapiro in the Core Reading, Resnik (1997). Parsons (1990), who introduced the terminology of eliminative and non-eliminative structuralism, is another must-read from around this time, developing a form of non-eliminative structuralism owing more to mathematical practice. See also the set-theoretic structuralism of Reck and Price (2000). For discussion of various problems and challenges for structuralism, see also Reck (2003), Shapiro (2006), and Macbride’s contribution to <strong>Shapiro</strong>, and, for useful introductory discussion, Hamkins (2021).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-7">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>There are various forms of neo-logicism, but the main approach to think about is the neo-Fregean approach of Bob Hale and Crispin Wright, which takes as its point of departure the fact that Peano Arithmetic can be derived from Hume’s Principle (HP) in the context of (standard) second-order logic. Hale and Wright developed their approach in various books and papers; besides the papers in their (2001) book, see their contribution to <strong>Shapiro</strong> and Wright’s (1983) book. In thinking about the approach more, there are various more specific issues to think about. One is the Julius Caesar problem. Neo-Fregeans suggest we can take HP as some sort of definition of the concept of number, but Frege himself thought that it could not be, as it doesn’t settle such questions as whether Julius Caesar is the number 0. Hale and Wright set out their official solution in ‘To Bury Caesar…’ in  the (2001) book, but see also pp. 107-17 of Wright (1983), where Wright sets out a rather different (and on some views, better) solution. A different set of issues concern HP itself. It’s important to the neo-Fregean position that it is an analytic truth of some sort. But is it? Boolos (1997) is a classic discussion of some of the main problems here. One is the so-called <em>bad company</em> objection: what distinguishes HP from abstraction principles which are either, like Frege’s Basic Law V, inconsistent, or at least not consistent with HP? For discussion this and other issues concerning HP, see Rayo’s contribution to <strong>Shapiro</strong>, Burgess (2005), Hale and Wright (2009), Linnebo, ed. (2009), Studd (2016), and various papers in Ebert and Rossberg, eds. (2016).</p>

## OTHER TOPICS

The following topics come up fairly regularly in past papers, and I recommend that, in selecting topics for the last two weeks of term, you choose at least one from these. To help you get a rough sense of what is involved, I have provided past paper questions for each topic, but I have not yet got round to settling on essay questions and reading for the majority of them, and even where I have, I may want to make some revisions. Consequently, let me as soon as possible if you want to study any of them, so as to give me time to make any necessary changes.

Should we accept the axiom of choice? (2018)  





ANALYSIS:

**EITHER**  
(a) Show how to compute the derivative of the function f(x)=x3 using infinitesimals in the classical style and by using the definition of the derivative via the epsilon-delta limit conception. Compare the two approaches, and identify exactly where Berkeley’s ghost of a departed quantity appears in your calculations. In what sense, if any, is one of these approaches superior to the other?

What is the philosophical significance, if any, of non-standard analysis? (2016)


GEOMETRY:

EITHER
(a) Discuss the significance of Tarski’s decision algorithm for geometry as a mathematical practice. What role does the infeasibility of the algorithm play?

COMPUTABILITY:

Consider two visions of the nature of computability: (i) the hierarchy vision, by which there is a hierarchy of computational power, with machines exhibiting increasing computational power as one ascends the hierarchy; and (ii) the threshold vision, by which all sufficiently powerful computational models are computationally equivalent in a suitable sense.

MISC.:



‘I laugh to think how presumptuous it would be to reject mathematics for philosophical reasons. How would you like to go and tell the mathematicians that they must change their ways, and abjure countless errors, now that philosophy has discovered [such and such]. Will you tell them, with a straight face, to follow philosophical argument wherever it leads? If they challenge your credentials, will you boast of philosophy’s other great discoveries: that motion is impossible, that a being than which no greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist, that it is unthinkable that anything exists outside the mind, that time is unreal, that no theory has ever been made at all probable by evidence (but on the other hand that an empirically ideal theory can’t possibly be false), that it is a wide-open scientific question whether anyone has ever believed anything, and so on, and on ad nauseam?
