<h1 id="philosophy-of-mind">Philosophy of Mind</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Mind. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/104%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind%20Oct%2010.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>. </p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, but I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of these. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>ANTHOLOGIES and TEXTBOOKS</strong></p>

<p>David Chalmers, ed. (2002) <em>Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings</em> (OUP), referred to as <strong>Chalmers</strong> below, contains many of the papers you’ll need. There are no set textbooks, but I strongly recommend that you pick up a copy of Jaegwon Kim’s <em>Philosophy of Mind</em>, 3rd ed. (Westview Press, 2010), which is an excellent introduction to the subject, written by one of its foremost theorists, and covers most of the topics we’ll look at. (The exceptions are action and perception, which are only briefly discussed in chapter 7.) Also recommended are:</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the type-identity theory, and what is the best argument for it? What problem does multiple realizability pose to the theory? Can it be met?  </p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the difference between analytic or common-sense functionalism and psychofunctionalism? Which is more plausible? Can Ned Block’s objection that “no version of functionalism can avoid both liberalism and chauvinism” be met?  </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
For further reading on this topic, you could do a lot worse than follow up the debates between Block and Sidney Shoemaker over absent and inverted qualia. Shoemaker (1975) is a good way in, while his (1981) is a careful discussion of different forms of functionalism. Byrne (2004/15) is a detailed discussion of philosophical arguments, including Block’s, that appeal to the possibility of spectral inversion.</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
Are <em>zombies</em> — creatures who are physically or functionally identical to us but lacking in consciousness — conceivable? If so, what problems, if any, does this pose for type-identity and functionalist theories of the mind?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Chalmers (2009) presents his influential Kripke-style modal argument against materialism, and responds to many of the objections that have pressed against it. Block and Stalnaker (1999) is a difficult, but extremely interesting critical discussion of both Levine’s and Chalmer’s arguments. Balog (2009) is a state of the art piece on the so-called <em>phenomenal concepts</em> strategy for defending materialism, which may be familiar to you from 1st year work on Frank Jackson’s Knowledge Argument.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Strawson (1979) argues that perceptual experiences strike us as involving the presentation of mind-independent objects. Harman (1990) argues for a closely related thesis, called <em>transparency</em> — roughly, that perceptual experiences don’t strike us as involving awareness of experiences themselves, but only of their mind-independent objects — and defends an intentionalist position akin to Anscombe’s. Martin (2002) is a critical discussion of the issue from a naive realist perspective. Nudds (2009) surveys recent work on naive realism.</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
Why does Davidson think that rationalising explanations are causal explanations? Is he right?</p>

<p><strong>CORE READING</strong><br />
Wayne Davis (2010) ‘The Causal Theory of Action’ in Timothy O’Connor and Constantine Sandis, eds. <em>A Companion to the Philosophy of Action</em> (Blackwell). Available <a href="http://www.oxford.eblib.com/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=496064">online</a>. </p>

<p>Other essential papers by Davidson on this topic are also collected in the <em>Intention and Action</em> section of his (2001), see especially ‘<a href="http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/0199246270.001.0001/acprof-9780199246274-chapter-3">Agency</a>’ and ‘<a href="http://ezproxy-prd.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:2153/view/10.1093/0199246270.001.0001/acprof-9780199246274-chapter-5">Intention</a>’. ‘Actions, Reasons, and Causes’, alongside Frankfurt (1978) and Hornsby (1993) below, is reprinted in Alfred Mele, ed. (1997) <em>The Philosophy of Action</em> (OUP). The introduction to this collection, which contains many other classic readings, is an excellent overview of both this and other central issues in the philosophy of action.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Frankfurt (1978) criticises causal accounts of action on the grounds that action involves (the capacity for) ongoing guidance of movement. Hornsby (1993) provides an alternative treatment of the problem discussed by Dretske. Velleman (1992) argues that Davidson’s account does not make sufficient allowance for the fact that agents are paradigmatically the causes of their actions. Setiya (2003) replies to this and other objections.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Can anomalous monism do justice to the causal relevance of mental properties? (2016)</p>

<p>Is it consistent to maintain that the mental supervenes on the physical, while denying that there are any psycho-physical laws? (2015)</p>

<p>‘The problem with Davidson’s anomalous monism is that it has the consequence that it is only qua physical events that mental events have physical consequences. The mental properties of mental events are epiphenomenal.’ Is this a consequence of anomalous monism? Is it a problem? (2014)</p>

## 7. INTERPRETATIONISM
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
Is there anything more to having a mind than being interpretable as if one had one?

**FURTHER READING**  

**PAST PAPER QUESTIONS**  
‘The claim that human beings have beliefs, desires, and intentions is a useful fiction. But it isn’t literally true.’ Discuss. (2016)

‘What it is to be a ... believer is to be an intentional system, a system whose behaviour is reliably and voluminously predictable via the intentional strategy.’ (DENNETT) Is this correct? (2015)

‘The correctness of propositional attitude attributions consists in this: that they contribute to the best possible interpretation of people – that is, the interpretation that makes the best sense possible of the people’s total life and conduct.’ Discuss. (2014)

What would it be to naturalize intentionality? Why might one want to do so? (2012)

Can those who propose to naturalize mental content adequately account for the normativity of the mental? (2010)

Self-Deception and Weakness of Will

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-deception/

‘The phenomenon of self-deception seems paradoxical only if we assume that people are perfectly rational and perfectly self-aware. But that assumption is obviously false. So there is really no difficulty in making sense of self-deception.’ Discuss. (2016)

‘The very idea of self-deception is a contradiction.’
‘The capacity for self-deception is an entrenched feature of human nature.’ Can these two statements be reconciled? (2013)

Is self-deception appropriately so-called? (2012)

Could there be self-deception without selves? (2011)

-->

<!-- 
INTERNALISM and EXTERNALISM

‘Anne’s Twin Earth doppelgänger is a physical replica of Anne. So there can be no causal difference between them. But if there is no causal difference between them, there can be no mental difference either. So externalism about content is false.’ Discuss. (2016)

What role, if any, does a subject’s socio-linguistic environment play in fixing the content of her propositional attitudes? (2015)

‘Broadmindedness [externalism about mental content] must deny either that intentional states as such have causes and effects or that relational properties cannot have immediate effects.’ (CRANE) Discuss. (2014)

Are there any reasons to think that the content of some mental states depends constitutively on the linguistic practices of society? (2013)

SELF-KNOWLEDGE

‘I get myself in a position to answer the question whether I believe that p by putting into operation whatever procedure I have for answering the question whether p.’ (EVANS) Does this observation point to a satisfying explanation of our knowledge of our own mental states? (2016)

How, if at all, can externalism about mental content be reconciled with first- person authority concerning our own beliefs and other propositional attitudes? (2014)

‘Mental self-knowledge involves no substantial cognitive achievement, it is merely an artefact of the grammar of mental concepts.’ Discuss. (2013)

'Each of us is especially authoritative about our own experiences and mental states, but there is no faculty of introspection.' Discuss. (2010)

OTHER MINDS 

Is our knowledge of other people’s mental properties a form of perceptual knowledge? (2016)

‘We routinely speak about seeing that there are some people in the waiting room, passengers on the bus, students in the office, and a crowd of people listening to the speaker. If what we routinely say is true, if we do see this sort of thing, then this is how we know (or, at least, one of the ways we know), that there are other minds.’ (DRETSKE) Discuss. (2014)
 
Compare and contrast two approaches to the epistemological problem of other minds. (2013)

Does inference to the best explanation provide a plausible solution to the problem of other minds? (2012)
