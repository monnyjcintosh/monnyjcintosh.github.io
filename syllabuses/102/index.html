<h1 id="knowledge--reality">Knowledge &amp; Reality</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge &amp; Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. In selecting them, I’ve particularly had PPL students, who are likely to go on to study Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Cognitive Science, in mind. Others may have different interests, however, and I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of the defaults. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS in EPISTEMOLOGY</strong> and <strong>METAPHYSICS</strong>.</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Knowledge &amp; Reality to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of this reading list at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>This is a large topic, and past paper questions on it cover a range of different issues. If you’re pursuing it further, you should make sure you’re familiar with the sorts of responses to the Gettier problem that first emerged in the 60s and 70s. See, in the first instance, the references in Ichikawa and Steup (2001/17) and Lycan (2006), above, and the various articles in Part II of Bernecker and Pritchard, eds. (2011). Particular things to think about are reliabilist approaches, for which see Goldman and Beddor (2008/15), and anti-luck and modal approaches, for which see the entry  on <a href="#epistemic_closure"><strong>EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</strong></a>. You should also have a look at virtue-theoretic approaches to knowledge, such as that of Sosa (2007). Otherwise, think about Williamson’s approach. At the very least, read Ch. 2 of <em>Knowledge and its Limits</em>, which fleshes out his defence of the claim that knowledge is a mental state. You’ll find useful discussion, together with responses from Williamson himself, in Greenough and Pritchard, eds. (2009). Particularly recommended are the pieces by Quassim Cassam and Elizabeth Fricker. See also Lowe (2002), Hyman (2014), the debate between Williamson and Trent Dougherty and Patrick Rysiew in Steup, Turri, and Sosa, eds. (2014), and the papers in the recently published volume, Carter, Gordon, and Jarvis, eds. (2017).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In getting a better grasp of this topic, I think it’s particularly helpful to understand how the notion of the <em>a priori</em> has figured in the history of philosophy. At the very least, you’ll want to look at Quine (1953). Though it doesn’t actually contain the expression “<em>a priori</em>”, it’s a renowned attack on what Bonjour calls moderate empiricism, and attempts to put a form of radical empiricism in its place. You’ll find good discussion of the issues in the first few chapters of Bonjour (1998), and a recent attempt to resuscitate moderate empiricism in the face of Quine’s attack in Boghossian (2003). In exploring contemporary work by other philosophers on the <em>a priori</em>, you should follow up the relevant references in Jenkins (2008). You’ll want to think, in the first place, about accounts of the <em>a priori</em> from the likes of Field and Peacocke, as well as Jenkins herself. Boghossian and Peacocke (2000) contains many key contributions to recent debate, including a paper by Kitcher reflecting on critical reaction to his (1980) paper. You’ll also want to think about Kripke, and alleged instances of contingent <em>a priori</em> truths. To that end, try Hawthorne (2002) and Chalmers (2008). (This is an issue that you’ll most likely encounter again if you do Philosophy of Mind, and certainly if you do Philosophical Logic.) Lastly, have a think a bit about whether the distinction between the <em>a priori</em> and the <em>a posteriori</em> is significant. Williamson (2013) is a recent paper arguing that it isn’t, Casullo (2015) a response.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>For an introduction to the other main issues for this topic, you won’t do better than chapters 3 to 8 of Dainton (2010). Inspired by McTaggart, the issues are usually posed in terms of a distinction between A-theory and B-theory—though see Parsons (2002) for discussion of what the core commitments here really are. Zimmerman and Smart (2008) is an accessible debate, with Zimmerman defending the main A-theory, <em>presentism</em>, and Smart defending the B-theoretic alternative, <em>eternalism</em>. Beyond that, think also about other A-theories, such as the so-called <em>growing block</em> and <em>moving spotlight</em> views. The papers by Correia and Rosenkranz and Braddon-Mitchell in Bennett and Zimmerman, eds. (2014) discuss the former; the latter was long regarded the poor relation among A-theories, but see Cameron (2015) for a recent and influential attempt to revive it. Another thing to think about is time travel. Is it possible? Does it pose a problem for particular views about time? Lewis (1976) argues that it’s possible. See also Vihvelin (1996) for discussion, and Wasserman (2017) for a recent book on the topic. Lastly, try Fine (2006), a fantastic, albeit rather tough-going paper discussing McTaggart, and offering an interesting interpretation of Dummett’s position.</p>

<p>Haslanger and Kurtz (2006) is an extremely useful collection, containing the relevant selection from Lewis (1986) and tons of other classic pieces. It should be your first port of call for further work on this topic. Hawthorne (2008) and Effingham (2012) are two good discussions of various issues concerning persistence. Einheuser (2012) is a nice discussion of the question whether there is a genuine problem of change—something about which, to lay my cards on the table, I’m pretty sceptical. Magidor (2016) is another nice discussion, running through a host of different arguments that are offered in the literature, arguing that they are strictly orthogonal to the debate between endurantists and perdurantists.</p>

<p>‘The following two claims are in tension: (1) There can be change over time; (2) At least some non-essential properties of objects are intrinsic.’ Explain how this tension might most plausibly be thought to arise. How would you propose to resolve it? (2016)</p>

Consider the portion of HEADY consisting of the whole statue except for its head, and call that object “HEADY-MINUS”. On the one hand, we should say that HEADLESS has gained a head and is thus identical to HEADY. On the other hand, we should say that HEADLESS is identical to HEADY- MINUS. But these statements cannot both be true.’ How should this quandary be resolved?<br />

I refer to it below as <strong>M&amp;B</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="past-paper-questions-4">PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</h4>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in more depth, Locke’s discussion in his <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (Bk II, Ch. 27) is essential reading, as are the famous replies from Thomas Reid and Joseph Butler. These are usefully collected, along with various other pieces, in Perry, ed. (2008). You’ll also want to think a bit about Williams. For some discussion, see the piece by Nozick in <strong>M&amp;B</strong>, Noonan (1982), and John Perry’s piece ‘Williams on The Self and the Future’ in Perry, ed. (2008). Otherwise, you should focus on Parfit and animalism. <strong>M&amp;B</strong> contains a number of pieces discussing Parfit: those by Lewis, Korsgaard, Unger, Sosa, Martin, Schechtman, and Johnston, as well as Parfit’s own ‘The Unimportance of Identity’. Lewis’s response is particularly important, and will seem less <em>ad hoc</em> if you’ve encountered his views on persistence more generally. For discussion of animalism, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Snowdon (1990) is an important statement and defence of the position. For other discussions, see Olson (2004), Shoemaker (2008), Madden (2011), and the collection, Blatti and Snowdon, eds. (2016)—the last containing a piece by Parfit arguing against animalism. For a recent book on personal identity, aimed at undergraduates, try Kind (2015).</p>

<p>Classic work on this topic includes the pieces by Anscombe, Strawson, and Peacocke that are reprinted in Noë and Thompson, eds. (2002). Harman (1990) and Tye (1992) are two more recent classics, both defending intentionalism and appealing to the idea that visual experience is in a certain sense <em>transparent</em>; see Martin (2002) for some critical dicussion of this. For more on disjunctivism, see in the first place the various pieces collected in Byrne and Logue, eds. (2009). Then take a look at Nudds (2009), a short survey piece on recent work on naïve realism and disjunctivism. For more on the arguments from illusion and hallucination, try the historically informed and sympathetic discussion in Smith (2002). Another thing to think about are so-called <em>causal theories</em> of perception. For discussion, see the papers by Grice, Lewis, and Snowdon in Noë and Thompson, eds. (2002). You’ll also find discussion of this in Ch. 7 of Fish (2010), a book aimed at undergraduates that covers all the main issues, and a good starting point for further study.</p>

Williamson Ch. 5 for further argument against KK. For reply, see Das and Salow (2018). Scepticism about the distinctiveness of self-knowledge, see Schwitzgebel (2008). Gertler (2011) for a first-rate book, aimed at undergraduates, on self-knowledge, expanding on her SEP article. Identifies three traditions. First views introspection as *sui generis*, drawing on Descartes. This is Gertler's own view. See esp. Ch. 4 of her book, and Fumerton (2005). Second tradition, stemming from Locke, treats it as perceptual. Part IV. of Shoemaker (1996) for influential criticism. Lycan (2003) for a defence.

Williamson's anti-luminosity argument has prompted a fair bit of critical response. For discussion, defending Williamson, see Srinivasan (2015). See also Das and Salow (2018), who defend the so-called *KK principle* that, if one knows that P, one is in a position to know that one knows it. 

For scepticism about the alleged distinctiveness of self-knowledge, see Schwitzgebel (2008).
For discussion of Moran's agential approach, try O'Brien (2003) and Lawlor (2009). 
Expressivism: Bar-On (2004).
For a first-rate introduction to the issues, see Gertler (2011)&mdash;a book-length alternative to her <i>Stanford Encyclopedia</i> article.

<p>DeRose (2009), the first of two volumes, is a statement and defence of contextualism. DeRose (2018), the second volume, is just out, and focuses on the application to scepticism and lottery puzzles. Brown (2006) defends an orthodox invariantist position, opposed both to contextualism and the subject-sensitive invariantism (SSI) endorsed by the likes of Hawthorne and Stanley. The debate between contextualism and SSI raises questions about the role of pragmatic elements in knowledge, or so-called <em>pragmatic encroachment</em>. Fantl and McGrath (2009) is a great discussion of this. Conee and Cohen (2014) is a useful debate for and against contextualism. It includes, among other things, discussion of whether contextualism provides a satisfactory response to scepticism.</p>

Can knowledge be analysed as justified true belief? If not, how, if at all should it be analysed?

#### FURTHER READING  
Weatherson (2003) is an interesting defence of the JTB analysis of knowledge. For virtue-theoretic approaches, see Sosa (2007) and Zagzebski (1996). The Gettier problem has received a great deal of attention from so-called experimental philosophers. See Nagel (2012) for critical discussion. Those interested in more formal approaches to epistemology will profit from Williamson (2013); in the same issue of *Inquiry* you'll find response articles from other philosophers and a reply from Williamson. For more on Williamson's views on knowledge, see the [Williamson on Knowledge](#williamson) topic.

#### PAST PAPER QUESTIONS  
How important is the concept of luck in epistemology? (2016)

What, if anything, is wrong with the view that knowledge is rationally held reliably true belief? (2015)

‘It’s too easy to come up with counterexamples to putative analyses of knowledge in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, so we should abandon the attempt to construct such analyses.’ Is this a compelling argument? And should we give up the project of analysing knowledge? (2014)

‘The theory that knowledge is justified true belief is a simple and powerful proposal. Just as we accept simple and powerful, but highly counterintuitive, theories in fundamental physics, so too we may accept the knowledge proposal despite its counterintuitive consequences.’ Discuss. (2012)

<p>If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the first three chapters of David Lewis’s (1986) book are essential. The first lays out a case for his brand of modal realism, the second defends it from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. Bricker and Melia (2008) is a recent debate; they defend concretism and ersatzism respectively. The remaining suggestions all discuss other approaches. Rosen (1990) defends a fictionalist approach. Melia (1992) argues against modalism, the view (roughly) that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explicated in terms of objects’ essences.</p>

<p>In working further on this topic, you could do worse than work through the chapters of Part 2 of Berto and Plebani (2015), looking more closely at papers focused on the views discussed. Try the paper by Kris McDaniels in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009) for an example of the Ontological Pluralism discussed in Ch. 4, and Linnebo (2012) for an example of Neo-Fregeanism. For the Neo-Carnapianism discussed in Ch. 5, try Hirsch (2002), Thomas Hofweber’s paper in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), and Thomasson (2008). Fictionalism, discussed in Ch. 8 of Berto and Plebani (2015), is particularly associated with defended in the piece above by Stephen Yablo. For Meinongianism, discussed in Ch. 7, try Crane (2011). Fine (2012) is an example of the Grounding Approach discussed in Ch. 8. You’ll find other various useful papers in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), along with a handy editors’ introduction. Two other recommendations: Lewis and Lewis (1970), a dialogue between two philosophers discussing whether there are holes, is a must-read, while Effingham (2013) is a fantastic introductory book, aimed at undergraduates and discussing issues of meta-ontology in relation to debates in specific areas of metaphysics. It can be profitably read in working further not just on meta-ontology, but also on topics such as <a href="#possible_worlds"><strong>POSSIBLE WORLDS</strong></a>, <a href="#time"><strong>TIME</strong></a>, and <a href="#persistence"><strong>PERSISTENCE</strong></a>.</p>

<p>What, if anything, ground truths about what grounds what? (2018)</p>

<p>What is the best methodology for resolving ontological disputes? (2015)</p>

<p>‘The standard of ontological commitment in metaphysics is the same as that in the sciences – one is committed to what one quantifies over in one’s best theory. Accordingly, it cannot be correct to castigate metaphysics as unscientific.’ Discuss. (2013)</p>

<p>Are ontological disputes merely verbal disputes over the choice of conventional linguistic framework? (2012)</p>

<!--
‘Existence is a property like any other.’ Discuss. (2011)-->
