<h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Ethics. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/103%20Ethics%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the following <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. We start with a week on the question, <em>Why Be Moral?</em>, setting up a debate on the status and source of morality that we explore over the rest of the term, beginning with two highlights of ethical thought in the early modern period, the work of Hume and Kant. We spend two weeks on contemporary normative ethics, looking at Consequentialism and Contractualism, but the final two weeks are left open for topics of your choice. Options here include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve had advice from various friends in putting together this reading list and its previous incarnations, and am particularly grateful to Chris Jay, Nadine Elzein, Stefan Sienkiewicz, Tom Sinclair, and Ed Lamb. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of it at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>We’ll be returning to this issue at points over the rest of the term, and you should think about how it might be tackled by the various thinkers we’ll be looking at. If you’re pursuing it in depth, Korsgaard (1996) is an excellent place to start, providing a potted history of early modern and more contemporary approaches to the question of the source of morality, and developing and defending a broadly Kantian approach. Hills (2010) is a more recent book-length treatment of the topic, discussing Korsgaard. McDowell (1978) is a response to Foot. Williams (1973) is a classic discussion of amoralism. See also Raz (1999), a difficult but rewarding paper arguing that there is no theoretically interesting difference between moral and other values. For discussion of the various forms of egoism—psychological, ethical, and rational—try in the first instance Shaver (2002/19). See also Elliot Sober’s paper on psychological egoism in <strong>LF&amp;P</strong>. Bloomfield, ed. (2008) contains lots of useful stuff—see especially the papers by Joyce, Nagel, Wedgwood, and Falk. You’ll also find good, relevant discussions in Part I of <strong>SL</strong> and Section I of <strong>Sher</strong>.</p>

If you're pursuing this topic in depth, it's useful to think about it from the perspectives of the various different approaches you've looked at during the rest of term. To this end, Korsgaard (1996) is an excellent place to start. Lecture 1 discusses the approaches of voluntarists like Gauthier and rationalists like Prichard. Lecture 2 looks at Humean, neo-Humean, and utilitarian approaches. Lectures 3 and 4 develop a Kantian approach. Hills (2010) is another good book-length treatment of the topic, and includes discussion of Korsgaard. Various other contemporary discussions are well worth looking at too. Williams (1973) offers a neo-Humean response to the amoralist. McDowell (1978) is a response to Foot (1972). Foot herself changed her view. See, in the first instance, the 'Recantation' in Stephen Darwall, Allan Gibbard, and Peter Railton, eds. (1997) <i>Moral Discourse and Practice: Some Philosophical Approaches</i> (OUP), but also her (2001) book, which is usefully read in conjunction with further study of [**VIRTUE ETHICS**](#virtue_ethics). Hooker (1997) argues that various attempts to show that moral virtue constitutes a benefit to the agent fail. Raz (1999) tries to defuse arguments to the effect that morality and self-interest are opposed. For contemporary discussion of egoism, see Elliot Sober's paper in **LF&P**. You'll also find various other good, relevant discussions in Part I of **SL**, Section I of **Sher**, Part IV of **DGR**, and in Bloomfield (2008). Wiggins (2006) discusses Plato. The rest of Wiggins' book is also strongly recommended, particularly as a recap in the vacations after you've completed this course.-->

<p>If you decide to pursue this topic further, the main issues to think about are (a) Hume’s account of motivation, and his criticisms of moral rationalism; (b) the role of sympathy and the common point of view in his account of moral judgement; and (c) his account of justice and promise keeping—though it’s mainly the first of these issues that comes up in past papers. While the <em>Treatise</em> is the main primary text, you should also look at Hume (1751/77), in which he presents things a bit differently. Hume thought that this latter work was “incomparably the best” of his writings. Also look at certain of his essays, found in Hume (1777)—particularly ‘<a href="https://davidhume.org/texts/empl/1/sc">The Sceptic</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://davidhume.org/texts/empl/1/st">Of the Standard of Taste</a>’. Turning to the secondary literature, Baillie (2000) is a good introduction to Hume’s ethics, aimed at undergraduates, and you’ll find good overviews of the contemporary debate in Radcliffe, ed. (2008). See especially the articles by Charlotte Brown, Kate Abramson, Elizabeth Radcliffe, Tom Beauchamp, and Nicholas Sturgeon. Particular highlights of the secondary literature on Hume include Mackie (1980), Cohon (2008)—the former a classic presentation of Hume as a forerunner to certain positions in twentieth century metaethics; the latter an influential corrective to that sort of reading—and the lectures on Hume in Rawls (2000).</p>

These provide references to other, important readings in the secondary literature, many of which are collected in Cohon, ed. (2001). You'll find good, introductory discussion in Baillie (2000), a book on Hume's ethics aimed at undergraduates. The lectures on Hume in Rawls (2000) are perhaps a little more advanced, but very influential. Major contributions to the contemporary meta-ethical literature on Humean issues include Korsgaard (1986), Quinn (1993), Dreier (1997), and Peter Railton's article in **Copp**.

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The 1970s and 80s saw a resurgence of interest in Kant’s ethics, largely due to the work of John Rawls and his students, Barbara Herman, Christine Korsgaard, and Onora O’Neill. His Harvard lectures on Kant’s ethics can be found in his (2000) book, listed in last week’s Further Reading. The first lecture on Kant is of most relevance for this week’s topic, and the second for next week’s, but all of the lectures on Kant are recommended. Beyond that, if you are pursuing this topic in more depth, Baron (1995) is essential. Part I addresses the worry—raised by Susan Wolf (1982)—that Kant’s emphasis on duty leaves no room for <em>supererogatory</em> actions, actions that go beyond the call of duty. Part II addresses the worry—raised by Stocker (1976) and Williams (1976)—that it leaves no room for motives like love and friendship. These are issues we’ll come back to again in future weeks. Arpaly (2003), discussing the case of Huckleberry Finn, argues that moral worth is a matter of acting for moral reasons, regardless of whether or not the agent recognises them as such. Sliwa (2016) is a recent response to this view. Guyer (2007) is a good book-length introduction to Kant’s ethics, aimed at advanced undergraduates.</p>

<p>O’Neill (1985) and Herman (1985) are two influential pieces on universalizability. O’Neill argues that, properly understood, Kantian universalization yields substantive constraints on action, while Herman argues that its use in moral deliberation presupposes knowledge of rules that guide the agent in the perception of morally relevant features of the circumstances in which the agent acts, and goes on to argue that this helps address various criticisms that have been pressed against Kantian approaches. Wood (1999) is a lively attempt to undermine what Wood takes to be the caricature of Kant as a rule fetishist who offers little more than an “ethical sausage-machine” for outputting right actions. Ch. 3 focuses on the Formula of Universal Law, arguing that Kant’s other formulations of the Categorical Imperative play a more fundamental role in his thinking, and discussing Herman, Korsgaard, and O’Neill in the process. Kleingeld (2017) is a more recent piece, stressing the significance of the fact that the Formula of Universal Law requires one to act on maxims that one can <em>simultaneously</em> will as universal laws. You’ll find the rest of Part One of Korsgaard (1996a) and Part I of Wood (1999) helpful in thinking about Kant’s other formulations of the Categorical Imperative, the Formula of Humanity as End-in-Itself and the Formula of Autonomy. See also the lectures on Kant in Rawls (2000) and the relevant chapter of Guyer (2007), both listed in last week’s Further Reading. Other good pieces on universalizability, as it figures either in Kant or in ethics more generally, include Williams (1985) and Wiggins (1987).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-4">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Many of you will be familiar with consequentialism from your first year study of Mill’s <em>Utilitarianism</em>, but in case you aren’t, Sinnott-Armstrong (2003/15) will get you up to speed. In further study, your main task will be to get a handle on how consequentialists have responded to various objections to their view, especially the demandingness objection. One strategy is to argue that it is not unreasonable for a morality to make the sorts of extreme demands that consequentialism is alleged to make. This is Singer’s strategy. It’s also the strategy pursued by Kagan (1989), a particularly influential book, which is well worth prioritising in further study of this week’s topic. Ashford (2000) pursues a similar line in response to Williams’ integrity objection. §2.1 of Mulgan (2001) critically discusses the strategy, which, following Kagan, he calls <em>extremism</em>, while Cullity (1994) is a response to Singer (1972). Another strategy is to deny that consequentialism gives rise to extreme demands in the first place. Jackson (1991) is an influential attempt of this sort, arguing that, since we can be more certain of maximizing utility if we focus our efforts on those closest to us, consequentialism does not require us to make the sorts of great personal sacrifice that its opponents sometimes claim. See §2.2 of Mulgan (2001) for critical discussion. Perhaps the most common strategy, however, is to argue that potential conflict with common-sense morality can be addressed by some <em>variant</em> of consequentialism. Scheffler (1982) and Railton (1984), in the Core Reading, are instances of this strategy, arguing that conflicts can be addressed by, respectively, hybrid or indirect forms of consequentialism. Kagan (1989) discusses Scheffler (see esp. Ch. 1 and 7), while Mason (1998) defends Railton. Hooker’s contribution to <strong>LF&amp;P</strong> pursues this line too, arguing that rule-consequentialism addresses the worry, while Norcross (2006) argues for a <em>scalar approach</em>. For critical discussion, see Mulgan (2001), starting with §2.3. Sobel (2007) takes a different line altogether, arguing that the demandingness objection depends for its force on prior non-consequentialist conclusions that need to be independently motivated.</p>

<p>In pursuing this topic in more depth, start by trying to get clear on what exactly the view is. It’s useful here to think about the objection that Scanlon’s contractualism is explanatorily redundant. Stratton-Lake (2003) explains why initial formulations of this objection were based on a misunderstanding, argues that the objection nevertheless re-emerges, and then goes on to offer a solution. Read that, and then read Ridge (2003), which argues that Scanlon cannot avail himself of Stratton-Lake’s solution to the “new and improved” redundancy objection without giving up some of his central commitments, but that contractualism’s not vulnerable to the objection in the first place. Next, think about the appeal of Scanlon’s contractualism, which lies in large part in its promise of accounts that are superior to those of its rivals of both the content and status of a central core of morality. The debate in the secondary literature debate has focused mainly on the contractualist account of the content of morality, and particularly on whether it offers an adequate response to worries about demandingness, aggregation, and risk. Hills (2010) is a response to Ashford’s treatment of the first question, concerning demandingness, while Scanlon (2003) includes discussion of Derek Parfit’s treatment of the second, concerning aggregation. On this issue, see also Otsuka (2006), Parfit (2011), and Scanlon (2011), which replies to Parfit. For discussion of the the third question, concerning risk, see Horton (2017). You will also want to think about the contractualist account of the status of morality. In doing so, it’s helpful to think about the contrast between the way Scanlon presents his contractualism in Ch. 4 of <em>What We Owe to Each Other</em> and his earlier, (1982) paper. Wallace (2002), in the Core Reading, is helpful too.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-6">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Virtue ethics emerged as an alternative to the two main approaches to normative ethics, consequentialism and deontology, in the second half of the twentieth century, but continues to draw much of its inspiration from Aristotle and his <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, which is essential reading—regardless of whether you plan on working on virtue ethics in any depth, really. Beyond that, start with Crisp and Slote, eds. (1997), especially the papers by Elizabeth Anscombe, Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell, as well as the very useful editors’ introduction. Highlights of recent work on the topic include Swanton (2003), presenting a detailed pluralistic account of the virtues, Driver (2004), defending a broadly consequentialist approach to the virtues, and Annas (2011), developing the idea that virtue is an exercise of practical intelligence. Aim to get a good grip on the various objections that have been raised against virtue ethics. Section 3 of Hursthouse and Pettigrew (2003/16), above, gives an overview, outlining eight different kinds of criticism. Part III of Besser-Jones and Slote, eds. (2015) is also very useful, containing surveys of work on a range of problems for virtue ethics. Many of these are variants of objections pressed against more traditional approaches in normative ethics, and it’s worth thinking about them in that context. One exception to this general rule is the <em>situationist objection</em>, which emerged out of work in social psychology. It is pressed by Harman (1999), and there’s a lot of discussion of it in the literature. Miller (2014) is a good place to start.</p>

<p>The further literature on this week’s topic is vast. With that, however, there is also a lot of good introductory literature. Gary Watson’s ‘Introduction’ to <strong>Watson</strong> is very helpful, offering a great overview of the issues, and you’ll find several useful entries in the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia</em>; the Related Entries section at the bottom of McKenna and Coates (2004/15), listed above, provides links. If you want a good book on the topic, aimed at advanced undergraduates, try McKenna and Pereboom (2016). In pursuing the topic in depth, you’ll want to think a bit more about van Inwagen’s consequence argument. The main thing to look at here is Lewis (1981). You’ll also want to think a bit more about Frankfurt’s challenge to the Principle of Alternate Possibilities and Peter Strawson’s account of moral responsibility in terms of reactive attitudes. To that end, Widerker and McKenna (2006) and McKenna and Russell (2008) are useful collections of articles, the former focused on Frankfurt and the latter on Strawson. But the main thing to do is familiarise yourself with contemporary libertarian, compatibilist, and sceptical approaches to free will and moral responsibility. See, in the first place, Chisholm (1964), Frankfurt (1971), Wolf (1987), and Strawson (1994). Then go on and look at the other papers in <b>Watson</b>, using the introductory literature above as your guide.</p>

<p>Moral realism comes in either of two varieties. Put crudely, <em>moral naturalism</em> is the view that moral properties are natural properties, while <em>moral non-naturalism</em> is the view that they are non-natural properties. For a long time, Moore’s (1903) open question argument was taken to show that moral properties had to be <em>sui generis</em>, non-natural properties, and so to show that non-naturalism was the only option for moral realists. Yet non-natural properties seem to be metaphysically dubious, or “queer”, as Mackie put it, and it’s difficult to see how we might provide a plausible account of how we can come to know about them. Many theorists therefore chose to reject moral realism altogether. Developments in the philosophy of language and mind led to a rethink, however, and the 1980s saw a resurgence of interest in moral naturalism, largely due to the work of the so-called <em>Cornell realists</em>, Boyd, Brink, Railton, and Sturgeon. See Lutz and Lenman (2006/18) for an overview, and think especially about the Moral Twin Earth objection to Cornell realism. Then try Sturgeon (1985), Brink (1989), and Jackson (1998)—the last the most prominent defender of the so-called <em>Canberra Plan</em>. More recently, there’s been a recent resurgence of interest in non-naturalism. See Ridge (2003/14) for an overview, and think especially about the supervenience problem. Then try McDowell (1985), a classic discussion of Mackie, and Shafer-Landau (2003) and Enoch (2011), two highlights of the recent revival. For a discussion and defence of Mackie’s argument(s) from queerness, see Olson (2014).</p>

<p>Supposing that utilitarianism is true, could we find out that utilitarianism is true in the same kind of way scientists found out that water is H<sub>2</sub>O? (2017)</p>

<p>‘There is no version of metaethical moral realism that can combine both metaphysical and epistemological plausibility, and so the realist project should be abandoned.’ Discuss. (2016)</p>

<p>‘The way the moral properties are distributed in a world cannot change without some natural properties changing. Therefore it is implausible to hold that moral properties are sui generis non-natural properties.’ Is this a good argument against non-naturalist moral realism? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) How worried should a moral realist be by the fact that there is no science of
ethics?<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration:line-through">(b) Are moral intuitions evidence of truth in ethics?</span> (2014)</p>

<!--**EITHER**  
(a) ‘Mixed normative facts [such as the fact that a particular consideration is a reason] depend on non-normative facts, and which non-normative facts they depend on is a normative matter, determined by the truth of pure normative claims. The truth of pure normative claims...does not depend on, or co-vary with, non-normative facts.’ (SCANLON) Does this solve the metaethical problem of supervenience for realists?  
**OR**  
(b) ‘We begin as (tacit) cognitivists and realists about ethics. ... Moral Realism should be our metaethical starting point, and we should give it up only if it does involve unacceptable metaphysical and epistemological commitments.’ (BRINK) Discuss. (2018) -->

<p>‘The omnipresence of desires in action is misleading, for it suggests that a desire must form the basis of every motivation. But in fact … [the desire] may often be motivated by precisely what motivates the action.’ (NAGEL) Discuss. (2018)</p>

<p>‘It’s a happy accident that, if I come to believe that some act is wrong, a corresponding desire not to do that act invariably follows. And most people are like me in this respect.’ Is this an adequate account of moral motivation? (2017)</p>

<p>‘Evil, be thou my good’. Can motivational internalism make sense of this? (2016)</p>

<p>‘To say that they possessed a reason … while acknowledging that any justificatory force of this reason is inaccessible to them as reasoning beings is, I think, not only a misuse of language, but undermines the point of discourse about reasons and rationality.’ (GERALD GAUS) Discuss. (2016)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration:line-through">(a) ‘Since morals have an influence on the actions and affections, it follows that they cannot be derived from reason… Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.’ (HUME) Discuss.</span><br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
(b) ‘It is no more puzzling that beliefs alone can motivate us than that desires alone can – it is merely less common that they do.’ Is that so? (2014)</p>
