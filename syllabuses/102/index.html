<h1 id="knowledge-and-reality">Knowledge and Reality</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge and Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, let me know, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover four topics in <strong>EPISTEMOLOGY</strong> (<a href="#knowledge">The Analysis of Knowledge</a>†, <a href="#closure">Epistemic Closure</a>†, <a href="#contextualism">Contextualism</a>, <a href="#statistical_evidence">Statistical Evidence</a>) and four in <strong>METAPHYSICS</strong> (<a href="#causation">Causation</a>, <a href="#modality">Modality</a>, <a href="#time">Time</a>, and <a href="#persistence">Persistence</a>). But this is not set in stone, and I have provided some suggestions for alternative topics. If you want to cover one of these instead, let me know, and I’ll see what we can do. Note that topics you may have covered in first year, and so might want to leave for self-study in vacations, are marked with a dagger (†).</p>

<p>The reading for each topic is divided into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>. In writing your tutorial essay, focus on the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, using  as guides the more introductory texts marked with a star (*) and any Faculty lectures on the topic—the lectures are often available online via <a href="http://www.canvas.ox.ac.uk/">Canvas</a>, and are a good indication of what might come up in the exams. You can then look at the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, as well as anything else on the <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/oxford/lists/76A93325-90FB-7907-BE8D-4E11EEA44C4E.html">Faculty Reading List</a>, when exploring topics in more depth during later vacations.</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Knowledge &amp; Reality to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. I’m grateful to various friends and colleagues for advice and discussion, especially Alex Kaiserman, Brent Madison, and Nick Tasker. If you’d like to use the list for teaching, please feel free. Feedback and corrections are gratefully received!</p>

<p>If you are not yet sure whether Knowledge &amp; Reality is the paper for you, have a look at the following overviews of metaphysics and epistemology for the <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i>, as well as the topics below, so as to better appreciate the sorts of issues you would be thinking and writing about.</p>

<p>If you have decided that you <em>are</em> taking the paper, it is a good idea to do some preliminary reading over the vacation beforehand. Choose from the following, relatively introductory textbooks. (Note that you needn’t read them all; it is enough to read one on epistemology and another on metaphysics.)</p>

<p>While most of the readings can be obtained online, it’s often useful to have good anthologies and collections of papers to hand, so as to be able to read around a bit more widely. The following are all recommended, containing many of the key readings and more besides, and are often referenced below.

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The background to this topic is, of course, Gettier (1963), arguing that justified true belief that P is not sufficient for knowledge that P. If you’re working on this topic in more depth, you’ll want to familiarise yourself with some of the many responses to Gettier’s paper. Pappas and Swain, eds. (1978) is useful here, collecting some of the most important contributions published in the first fifteen years afterwards. Zagzebski, in the Core Reading, attempts to draw a general lesson from the debate, as does Blome-Tillman (2007), to whom Kearns (2007) replies. At first sight, Zagzebski’s paper suggests a dilemma: in analysing knowledge as true belief plus some further condition X, the third condition will either be non-factive, and liable to counter-example, or factive, but extremely demanding, ruling out much of what we intuitively deem to be knowledge. As Lycan explains, however, this isn’t quite right. Various of the candidates that have been offered for X have been factive and yet not obviously overly demanding. Consider, for example, a crude causal analysis, on which S knows that P IFF S has a true belief that is causally connected to the fact that P. Much of the contemporary debate takes its cue from this observation, and investigates the prospects for, <em>inter alia</em>, anti-luck, sensitivity, and safety approaches to the analysis of knowledge. For anti-luck approaches, see the debate between Pritchard and Hetherington, ‘Can Knowledge Be Lucky?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>; you can look at the latter two approaches in more depth in connection with <a href="#closure"><strong>EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</strong></a>. See also the virtue-theoretic approach of Sosa (2007), among others. One of the main questions to consider is whether these approaches, while avoiding counter-examples constructed in accordance with Zagzebski’s recipe, nevertheless run into problems with the sort of Barn County cases described by Goldman (1976). See, for example, Gendler and Hawthorne (2005). A related question, arising out of debates surrounding safety-based approaches, is whether a successful analysis need be non-circular to be illuminating. You’ll find discussion of many of the issues in Borges, de Almeida, and Klein, eds. (2017), including a contribution from Zagzebski reflecting on her earlier (1994) paper. Williamson’s view that knowledge is a mental state, and should be taken as an explanatory primitive in epistemology, has been very influential. In thinking about it more, you’ll find plenty to chew on in Greenough and Pritchard, eds. (2009). See also the debate between Williamson and Dougherty and Rysiew, ‘Should Knowledge Come First?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>. You can explore a key aspect of Williamson’s position—his view that there are no <em>luminous</em> conditions, i.e. conditions such that, whenever they obtain, one is in a position to know that they obtain—in doing <a href="#internalism&amp;externalism"><strong>INTERNALISM and EXTERNALISM</strong></a>. Craig (1990) offers an analysis of knowledge, motivating it not by appeal to intuitions but by reflection on the role the concept of knowledge plays for us—a <em>function-first</em> approach. For discussion, try Williams (2002). For more on the methodological significance of intuitions, see Weatherson (2003), defending the JTB analysis, Gettier cases notwithstanding.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Dretske (1970) offers a range of arguments against closure. Perhaps the most interesting is based on a <em>relevant alternatives</em> account of apparent counter-examples, such as that of the zebra that, intuitively, you know to be a zebra but don’t know is not a cleverly disguised mule. Knowing that P, Dretske suggests, requires ruling out all relevant alternatives to P, where an alternative Q to P is <em>relevant</em> IFF Q is true in at least some of the close by worlds in which P is false. While you can rule out all relevant alternatives to such propositions as that it is a zebra before you, you cannot rule out all relevant alternatives to the proposition that it is not a cleverly painted mule. In particular, you cannot rule out the proposition that it <em>is</em> a cleverly painted mule. Of various responses to Dretske’s article, Stine (1976) is a highlight, working within the same relevant alternatives framework, but defending closure by offering an alternative account of what it is for an alternative to be relevant—one that, in retrospect, amounts to a prototypical form of <a href="#contextualism"><strong>CONTEXTUALISM</strong></a>. Vogel (1990) is another good discussion. Nozick’s (1983) truth-tracking or sensitivity account of knowledge, which may be familiar to you from first year work for General Philosophy, is a variation on Dretske’s relevant alternatives theme, and has been widely discussed. Kripke’s influential (2011) paper was circulated in manuscript form for many years, and argues that Nozick’s account leads to wildly implausible violations of closure. In thinking more about the issues here, look at rival approaches, especially the safety approach defended by Sosa (1999), among others, and the modified version of Nozick’s own sensitivity approach defended by Roush (2005). See also Williams (1996), Ch. 7 of Williamson’s (2000) <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i>—listed as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for <a href="#knowledge"><strong>THE ANALYSIS of KNOWLEDGE</strong></a>—and the debate between Dretske and Hawthorne, ‘Is Knowledge Closed Under Known Entailment?’ in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>. There are various issues concerning whether Nozick’s position affords a viable response to <a href="#scepticism"><strong>SCEPTICISM</strong></a>. One question, explored by Williamson, is whether it has unacceptable sceptical implications itself. Another: isn’t it question-begging, relying on the assumption that we’re not in the bad case? For a short, classic presentation of the worry, one which might be raised against externalist responses to the sceptic quite generally, see Craig (1989). Sharon and Spectre offer a novel approach. Like Dretske and Nozick, they base their argument against closure on an explanation of apparent counter-examples. Unlike Dretske’s and Nozick’s, however, their explanation does not involve externalism, but is based rather what they call the <em>openness of evidence</em>. For discussion, see Comesaña (2017), as well as Sharon and Spectre’s (2017b) reply.</p>

<p>Put roughly, epistemic contextualism is the view that the truth-conditions of sentences of the form, <u>S knows that P</u>, depend on epistemologically significant features of the context of utterance. (The qualification that the relevant features are epistemologically significant matters: pretty much everyone accepts that the truth-conditions of the sentences in question depend on some features of the context of utterance, if only because of their tense.) It stands in opposition to <em>invariantism</em>, the view that the truth-conditions of sentences of the form, <u>S knows that P</u>, don’t depend on epistemologically significant features of the context of utterance. The idea goes back at least as far as the 70s—see especially Gail Stine’s paper, listed in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#closure"><strong>EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</strong></a>. But the key papers came out a little later. See especially Cohen (1988), DeRose (1996), and Lewis (1996), combining the infallibilist idea that knowing that P is a matter of having evidence that rules out all possibilities in which ¬P with the idea that the domain of quantification (“<em>all</em> possibilities”) is subject to contextual restriction. Various arguments for contextualism have been advanced. Perhaps the most promising—the so-called <em>context shifting arguments</em>—focus on intuitions about how the truth values of certain sentences vary across certain sorts of contexts. In thinking about the topic in more depth, think carefully about what exactly these various arguments show. <em>Classical</em> invariantists try to explain away the relevant intuitions. Brown in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, for instance, argues that they can be explained in terms of warranted assertability. See also the debate between Conee and Cohen, ‘Is Knowledge Contextual?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>. <em>Subject sensitive</em> invariantists (also known as <em>interest relative</em> or <em>sensitive moderate</em> invariantists) offer an alternative response, arguing that the variation in truth value, while often genuine, reflects variation in epistemologically significant features, not of the context of <em>utterance</em>, i.e. of the <em>ascriber</em> or speaker, but of the context of the <em>subject</em>. This involves making a quite radical move, on which the epistemic status of a subject depends not just on truth-related factors such as her evidence, but also on pragmatic factors such as her practical interests. This <em>pragmatic encroachment</em> has become something of a hot topic lately. In addition to Hawthorne in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, it’s defended by Stanley (2005) and Fantl and McGrath (2009). See also the debate between Fantl and McGrath and Reed, ‘Do Practical Matters Affect Whether You Know?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong> and, for the state of the art, various of the papers on the proposal in Kim and McGrath, eds. (2019). DeRose in his (2009) book, responds to both strategies in defence of contextualism. Contextualism is primarily a thesis in the philosophy of language, but one that its proponents typically claim has important consequences for epistemology, and especially <a href="#scepticism"><strong>SCEPTICISM</strong></a>. For some pushback against this, see Feldman (1999) and Sosa (2000). The debate between Conee and Cohen, ‘Is Knowledge Contextual?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>, is also relevant here, as is Stroud (1984), a classic discussion of whether scepticism rests on setting overly demanding standards for knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-4">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>This week’s topic is the debate between internalists and externalists about epistemic justification. Put roughly, internalists about justification hold that whether or not a subject’s belief is justified depends only on internal factors, while externalists deny this, and insist that whether or not a subject’s belief is justified may depend on external factors—whether or not it was produced by a reliable process, for example. The debate goes back to the late 70s. Bonjour (1980) is a key contribution, and may be familiar to you from first year work in General Philosophy. He presents various examples of clairvoyants, like the famous Norman, which suggest that purely external factors are insufficient for justification; the so-called <em>new evil demon problem</em>, discussed in Cohen (1984), suggests that they aren’t necessary either. Other arguments for internalism are more theoretical, often making use of the idea that justification is a deontological concept, to be understood in terms of the concepts of permission, duty, and obligation. See, for instance, the guidance argument presented and criticised in Goldman (1999), as well as the argument from akrasia presented in Smithies (2012) and criticised in Salow (2019). See also Bergmann (2006) and Gibbons (2006), two critiques of internalism. Recent debate has often focused on the issues raised by the anti-luminosity argument presented in Ch. 4 (and again in Ch. 8) of Williamson (2000). Berker (2008), in the Core Reading, criticises the argument, arguing that it trades on controversial views about vagueness; Srinivasan (2013) replies. Schoenfield (2015) argues that internalism can be defended without luminosity; Wedgwood (2017) takes a similar line. A key issue here is how internalism is best understood: as <em>access internalism</em>, the view that whether or not an agent’s belief is justified depends only on facts that are reflectively accessible to that agent? Or as <em>mentalism</em>, the view that whether or not an agent’s belief is justified depends only on facts about the agent’s mental states? Access internalism is probably the orthodox position, and the one that is most obviously targeted by the anti-luminosity argument. For an influential defence of mentalism, see Feldman and Conee (2001). See also the debate between Greco and Feldman, ‘Is Justification Internal?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>. The anti-luminosity argument is arguably the centrepiece of Williamson (2000), but you might also want to take a look at Ch. 9, where, taking his <em>knowledge-first</em> approach, he explains justification in terms of knowledge, arguing both that one is justified in believing something IFF it is supported by one’s evidence and that E=K, i.e. one’s evidence just is one’s knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-5">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The topic this week is the structure of epistemic justification, and Agrippa’s trilemma, or the regress problem: for S’s belief that P to be justified, it seems S has to have a reason for that belief, but if her reason for that belief is another belief, it must also be justified; an infinite regress of reasons thus seems to loom. Going back at least as far as Aristotle, it has often been argued that the solution to the problem is <em>foundationalism</em>, the view that the regress terminates with a class of <em>non-inferentially</em> justified beliefs, or <em>basic</em> beliefs: beliefs that do not depend for their justification on further beliefs. Bonjour, in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, presents an influential argument against foundationalism, revolving around two ideas: first, the strongly internalist idea that one’s belief is justified only if one is in possession of a reason for thinking that the belief is likely to be true; second, that possessing a reason for thinking a belief is likely to be true is a matter of having justified beliefs that entail that it is likely to be true. In response, some reject the strong internalism. See, for example, the essays in Part I of Alston (1989), especially ‘What’s Wrong with Immediate Knowledge?’, and, for the broader issues at stake in debates over internalism, <a href="#internalism&amp;externalism"><strong>INTERNALISM &amp; EXTERNALISM</strong></a>. Others offer responses that are compatible with the internalism, rejecting instead the idea that possessing a reason for thinking a belief is likely to be true is matter of having further justified beliefs. They thus face the challenge posed by the <em>Sellarsian dilemma</em> developed in section IV of Bonjour’s paper. Huemer, in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, offers a response to this. His <em>phenomenal conservatism</em> is one of the main developments in recent work. See also Pryor’s similar <em>dogmatist</em> approach, which he defends in a debate with Comesaña in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>, ‘Is There Immediate Justification?’. For critical discussion of their approaches, see the various papers in Tucker, ed. (2013). See also the various readings discussing Pryor’s dogmatism suggested in connection with <a href="#scepticism"><strong>SCEPTICISM</strong></a>. 
Huemer and Pryor are <em>moderate</em> foundationalists, holding, in contrast to the more demanding classical or <em>strong</em> foundationalism associated with the likes of Descartes, that basic beliefs need not be infallible, indubitable, or incorrigible. For an alternative response to the Sellarsian dilemma, offered in defence of a form of strong foundationalism, try Fumerton (1995). For an interesting externalist response, see Lyons (2008). 
In arguing against foundationalism, Bonjour joined a tradition that stretches back to the Pyrrhonians, a group of sceptics (including Agrippa) who lived between the 4th and 1st centuries BCE. Bonjour’s argument was offered as part of an attempt to defend not scepticism, but <em>coherentism</em>, the view that the justification of a belief depends on how it coheres within one’s entire system of beliefs. See Part II of his (1985). Bonjour himself eventually abandoned coherentism for strong foundationalism, however, as he explains in his contribution to Bonjour and Sosa (2003)—he replies to his earlier argument against foundationalism in Ch. 4—and coherentism seems to have fallen somewhat out of favour in recent times. See Olsson’s (2003/21) survey for an overview of work on the topic, as well as the debate, ‘Can Belief Be Justified Through Coherence Alone?’, between Elgin and van Cleve in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>, and section 2 of Huemer’s accessible (2010) article. Alongside coherentism’s demise, however, there has been a lot of interest in <em>infinitism</em>, the view, defended by Klein in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, that a belief may be justified by an infinite (non-repeating) chain of reasons. For discussion, see Turri and Klein, eds. (2015), as well as the debate between Klein and Ginet, ‘Is Infinitism the Solution to the Regress Problem?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>. Section 3 of Huemer (2010) discusses Klein’s and another problem for foundationalism, the <em>bootstrapping</em> or <em>easy knowledge problem</em>, raised by Cohen (2002).</p>

<p>We’ve looked at some responses to external world scepticism in previous weeks already, especially in connection with <a href="#closure"><strong>EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</strong></a> and <a href="#contextualism"><strong>CONTEXTUALISM</strong></a>. You may also be familiar with various other responses from first year work for General Philosophy, in particular the semantic externalist response associated with Hilary Putnam and the epistemic externalist response associated with reliabilists, like Alvin Goldman. You’ll find classic pieces on all these in DeRose and Warfield, eds. (1999), listed in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, which is an invaluable resource, and good pieces on closure-denying, contextualist, and epistemic externalist responses in another very useful collection, Greco, ed. (2008). For more on semantic externalism, see also the excellent Button (2013). You’ll also want to think about various internalist responses, not represented in the DeRose and Warfield collection. For starters, there’s the <em>epistemological disjunctivism</em> of McDowell (1982), listed in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>. For criticism, see Wright (2002). <!--EXPLAIN. Link with Williamson.--> <!--Discussion in Part III of Dodd and Zardini.--> Millar’s piece in Greco, ed. (2008), provides an overview, and there are connections with issues you can explore in doing <a href="#perception"><strong>PERCEPTION</strong></a>; see, in the first instance, Ch. 5 of Soteriou (2016), listed there as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>. There are also interesting similarities between the epistemological disjunctivist approach to scepticism and Williamson’s—see his (2009) as well as Ch. 8 of his (2000) book, listed as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for both <a href="#knowledge"><strong>THE ANALYSIS of KNOWLEDGE</strong></a> and <a href="#internalism&amp;externalism"><strong>INTERNALISM and EXTERNALISM</strong></a>. <!--The no-Moorean *dogmatism* of Pryor (2000) in the **CORE READING**, and criticised in White (2006) and Siegel (2012), is more orthodox, holding that there's an evidential symmetry between good and bad cases. Similar to Huemer's PC...--> There’s also the neo-Moorean <em>dogmatism</em> of Pryor (2000) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, and criticised in White (2006) and Siegel (2012). Pryor’s dogmatism is very similar to Huemer’s phenomenal conservatism, as mentioned in the guide to the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#agrippa"><strong>AGRIPPA’S TRILEMMA</strong></a>, and the readings suggested there on the latter will also be relevant to the former. Lastly, contrasting with both epistemological disjunctivist and dogmatist responses, there is the <em>apriorist</em> response of, e.g., Wright (2004). Vogel’s contribution to Greco, ed. (2008) is also useful here, discussing dogmatism, apriorism, and the debate between them. See also Vogel’s contribution to his debate with Fumerton, ‘Can Skepticism Be Refuted?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>. In thinking about apriorism, think also about <a href="#a_priori"><strong>THE A PRIORI</strong></a>, and how, if at all, apriorists might account for how we can acquire the <em>a priori</em> knowledge and justification they posit. One issue bearing on many of the debates, is that of what, if anything, is wrong with Moore’s proof of the external world. See Wright (2002), Pryor (2004), and Coliva (2013), as well as Ch. 3 of Stroud (1984), listed in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#contextualism"><strong>CONTEXTUALISM</strong></a>.</p>

<p><em>A priori</em> knowledge or justification is, to a first approximation, knowledge or justification that is had independently of experience. Independent how, exactly? In particular, is it supposed to be <em>indefeasible</em>? It was standardly thought that it was, but the 1980s saw the beginning of some pushback against this. See Kitcher (1980), defending indefeasibility, and Casullo (1988), criticising it. The issue bears on what is perhaps the central question, whether the possibility of <em>a priori</em> knowledge or justification can be explained in terms of analyticity, or mastery of concepts. The suggestion that it can dominated discussion of the <em>a priori</em> going back to Hume—see the chapter from A. J. Ayer’s (1936) book, <em>Language, Truth, and Logic</em>, reprinted in Moser, ed. (1987) for a classic statement of the view—but fell out of favour in the wake of the famous attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction in W. V. O. Quine’s (1956) ‘Two Dogmas of Empiricism’, also reprinted in Moser, ed. (1987). A central element of the attack was that no statement is immune to revision. But if <em>a priori</em> knowledge and justification is defeasible, this doesn’t seem to be a pressing concern. Other worries about the analyticity, or mastery of concepts approach remain. For one thing, it seems subject to counterexamples. ‘Nothing is both red and green all over’ is a famous case in point. It is supposed to be knowable <em>a priori</em>, but it is notoriously hard to see how it can be analytic. But the deepest challenge, pressed by Bonjour (1998) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, is to explain how the proposal is supposed to work: how exactly does mastery of concepts yield <em>a priori</em> knowledge or justification? Boghossian (2003) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> defends one, seemingly promising answer, appealing to <em>inferentialism</em>, the view that mastery of at least certain concepts (most plausibly logical concepts) is constituted by being disposed to reason with them in certain ways: to grasp the concepts <em>or</em> and <em>not</em>, for example, is just to be disposed to reason in accordance with their introduction and elimination rules. These dispositions, the thought goes, determine certain judgements (<em>it’s raining or it’s not raining</em>, for example) to be true and certain inferences (from <em>it’s raining</em> to <em>it’s raining or 2+2=5</em>, for example) to be valid. In making these judgements and inferences, therefore, the agent who grasps the relevant concepts makes judgements and inferences whose truth or validity is guaranteed, and so justified. Various worries can be raised about the strategy, however. First, there’s the <em>defective concepts</em> worry, that the dispositions to reason associated with certain concepts—Arthur Prior’s <em>tonk</em> is a famous case—determine judgements and inferences that are not true or valid. Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, it has been questioned whether mastery of concepts is ever constituted by dispositions to reason in certain ways. Philosophers of logic disagree, for example, about the introduction and elimination rules of <em>not</em>, but it seems mistaken to think that either party need fail to grasp the concept. Both worries are raised by Field (2005) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and in considerable detail by Williamson (2007)—see §2 for the first worry, and §3 for the second. There has been an ongoing and fruitful debate between Williamson and Boghossian about inferentialism and the <em>a priori</em> more generally, which is collected together and continued in their (2020) book. For another way of trying to explain <em>a prioricity</em> in terms of mastery of concepts, see Jenkins (2012). Bonjour offers an alternative, <em>rationalist</em> account in Ch. 4 to 6 of his (1998) book, explaining the <em>a priori</em> in terms not of mastery of concepts, but of rational intuition or insight into the necessary structure of the world. In thinking about all of these approaches, you’ll want to think about Kripke’s examples of apparently contingent <em>a priori</em> truths. See the extracts from his (1980) <em>Naming and Necessity</em> in Moser, ed. (1987), as well as the discussion in the papers there by Casullo, Swinburne, and Kitcher. See also Chalmers (2004), who attempts to defuse the problem by appeal to a distinction between deeply and superficially contingent <em>a priori</em> truths: to pose a genuine problem, the idea runs, Kripke’s examples would need to be examples of the former, but they are in fact examples of the latter. (Chalmers employs the framework of two-dimensional modal logic, which will be familiar to those of you doing Philosophical Logic.) See also Hawthorne (2002), however, tentatively offering what seem to be examples of deeply contingent <em>a priori</em> truths. Think also about Field’s <em>nonfactualism</em> and Quine’s radical empiricism, critically discussed in Ch. 3 of Bonjour (1998). See also the debate, ‘Is There A Priori Knowledge?’, between Bonjour and Devitt, a radical empiricist, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>. Lastly, think about whether the distinction between <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> is all that clear, or theoretically significant anyway. See Hawthorne (2007) and Williamson’s ‘How Deep is the Distinction between A Priori and A Posteriori Knowledge?’, reprinted in Boghossian and Williamson (2020), who argue it isn’t, and Casullo’s (2015) reply.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-8">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Much of what we know and justifiedly believe we come to know or to have justification for believing by accepting what others tell us, i.e. <em>through testimony</em>. But how exactly does the acquisition of knowledge and justification through testimony work? According to <em>reductionists</em>, it is a matter of acquiring other beliefs providing us with good reasons for accepting the speaker’s testimony, putting us in the position to offer arguments of the form, “<em>S said that P</em>; <em>S’s testimony to P is reliable</em>; so <em>P</em>.” (It’s called <em>reductionism</em> because it holds that testimonial knowledge and justification <em>reduce</em> to knowledge and justification acquired in other ways, namely perception and induction.) But reductionism is problematic. One objection—see, for instance, Coady (1992) and §5.2 of Lackey (2008)—is that, owing to limitations in what we can observe, we generally can’t take the relevant steps to verify speakers’ testimony. Reductionism thus seems to lead to scepticism. In response, reductionists try to argue we <em>can</em> establish the reliability of testimony. Lipton (1998) and Malmgren (2006), for example, appeal to inference to the best explanation, while Fricker (1994), in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, argues we have a capacity for monitoring speakers for trustworthiness. See also Kenyon (2013), arguing that context provides a lot more information than its critics suppose, and Ch. 2 and 3 of Faulkner (2011), defending reductionism against the charge of scepticism but arguing that it over-intellectualises testimony. <em>Nonreductionists</em> offer a different account of how the acquisition of knowledge and justification through testimony works, on which we have a special entitlement to believe what we are told, regardless of any reasons we might be able to offer in support of it. (It’s called <em>nonreductionism</em> because it holds that testimonial knowledge and justification <em>don’t</em> reduce to knowledge and justification acquired in other ways, but are instead epistemologically distinctive.) The details of their views often mirror positions you might have looked at in connection with <a href="#scepticism"><strong>SCEPTICISM</strong></a>. Burge (1993), in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, for example, holds that we have a default but defeasible entitlement to accept a speaker’s testimony, paralleling the dogmatist’s claim that we have a similar entitlement to accept perceptual appearances, while McDowell (1994) appeals to a form of epistemological disjunctivism to argue that we have an entitlement to presume that a speaker’s testimony expresses knowledge where doing so is not doxastically irresponsible. See also Coady (1992), arguing for nonreductionism on the basis of the intelligibility of testimony, and Goldberg (2007), arguing for a reliabilist-based nonreductionism. Perhaps the main criticism of nonreductionism is that it amounts to a licence for gullibility. Fricker (1994) provides a classic statement of the worry. See also §5.3 of Lackey (2008) and Ch. 5 of Faulkner (2011). Some theorists have tried to move beyond the opposition between reductionism and nonreductionism, developing hybrid views of various sorts. See especially the <em>dualism</em> of Lackey (2008) and the <em>trust theory</em> of Faulkner (2011)—though Faulkner argues that Lackey’s approach is in fact a form of reductionism. Faulkner’s theory draws on aspects of a further approach to the question of how the acquisition of knowledge and justification through testimony works: via <em>faith</em>. On the face of it, this might seem implausible: whether or not I place my trust in a speaker may have moral and, more broadly, practical implications, but does it really have epistemic implications? Moran (2005), in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, is an influential defence of the idea, which has connections with the issue of <a href="#epistemic_injustice"><strong>EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE</strong></a> too. For critical discussion, try Ch. 8 of Lackey (2008) and the response in §6.5 of Faulkner (2011). If you’re thinking about testimony in depth, you should also think about whether or not it only serves to “transmit” knowledge and justification—whether, roughly, the acquisition of knowledge or justification through testimony requires that the speaker knows or justifiedly believes it too. Nonreductionists like Burge and McDowell think that it does—though see Edwards (2000) for a discussion of whether Burge’s position, as stated, manages to secure this result. Lackey influentially argues that testimony can not just transmit but also <em>generate</em> knowledge, however. See, for instance, Ch. 2 of her (2008) and, for some critical discussion, Ch. 3 of Faulkner (2011).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-9">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The epistemology of disagreement is a relatively recent topic, emerging only in the past twenty five years or so out of debates in the philosophy of religion. The main question is whether the discovery that you disagree with an epistemic peer about some proposition ever provides you with reason to revise your doxastic attitudes towards it—to move from belief that P to suspension of judgement, say, or from a high credence in P to a lower one. Proponents of <em>steadfastness</em> argue that it doesn’t, while proponents of <em>conciliatorism</em> argue that it does, although different conciliatorists offer different accounts both of the conditions under which discovering such disagreement provides you with reason to revise and of the strength or weight of the reason that it provides. Elga (2007), like Feldman (2007) and Christensen (2007) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, defends an <em>equal weight</em> account, on which the discovery of disagreement always provides you with a reason for revising your current attitude that has equal weight with your reason for retaining it. Lackey (2010) defends a <em>justificationist</em> account, on which whether the discovery of disagreement gives you a reason for thinking your belief is mistaken depends on the strength of your antecedent justification for that belief: if it is sufficiently high, what you gain is a reason for thinking, not that your belief is mistaken, but that your interlocutor is not your epistemic peer after all. See also the <em>total evidence</em> account, defended by Kelly in his contribution to Feldman and Warfield, eds. (2010), on which your <em>first-order</em> evidence (evidence for and against a proposition) can at least partially defeat your <em>higher-order</em> evidence (evidence about your first-order evidence), including evidence flowing from the discovery of peer disagreement. This paper represents a change of mind for Kelly, who in his earlier (2005) paper, listed in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, appeals to the distinction between first- and higher-order evidence to defend a steadfast approach. See also Titelbaum (2015), defending Kelly’s earlier Right Reasons View, and Lasonen-Arnio (2014), discussing the signficance of higher-order evidence. For other defences of steadfastness, see van Inwagen (1996), appealing to considerations of private evidence, as well as Enoch (2010) and Wedgwood’s ‘Moral Evil Demons’ in Feldman and Warfield, eds. (2010), appealing to considerations of self-trust. Conciliatorism in one form or another is often motivated by appeal to examples, such as the restaurant case in Christensen (2007) and the horse race case in Elga (2007). More theoretical arguments focus on testimony and putative analogies with devices like thermometers—see Enoch (2010) for critical discussion of the latter. Feldman (2007) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> argues for conciliatorism on the basis of the <em>uniqueness thesis</em>, the claim that, for any body of evidence E and proposition P, there is at most one doxastic attitude towards P that is supported by E. For discussion, see Kelly (2010), Schoenfield (2014) and the debate between Kelly and White, ‘Can Evidence be Permissive?’, in <strong>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</strong>. Problems for conciliatorism include the worry that it leads to scepticism and is self-defeating. See various of the papers in Machuca, ed. (2013) for more on conciliatorism and scepticism. For more on self-defeat, see Elga’s paper in Feldman and Warfield, eds. (2010), Littlejohn’s in Machuca, ed. (2013), and the papers by Christensen and Weatherson in Christensen and Lackey, eds. (2013).</p>

One issue here is the extent to which the phenomenal character of perceptual experience is determined by intrinsic, non-intentional qualities of the experience, or <em>qualia</em>. Papineau (2014) defends an extreme view, opposed to both intentionalism and disjunctivism, on which the phenomenal character of perceptual experience is <em>wholly</em> determined by such qualia.

<p>For a classic presentation of the suggestion that there is a distinctive epistemological problem of other minds, concerning a contrast between how we know about our own minds and how we know about others’—what Gomes (2018) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> calls the <em>problem of sources</em>—see Ayers (1953). One response to it, offered by the likes of Mill and Russell, is to argue that our knowledge of other minds is based on an <em>inference</em> of some sort.

<p>Start with one or more of the introductory readings, marked with a star (*). Then read each of the unstarred readings, which are more advanced—preferably in the order in which they are listed. 
Armstrong (1989) defends a moderate <em>realism</em>, holding that properties are <em>universals</em>, entities that are numerically identical across their different instantations, and rejecting along the way both various forms of nominalism and the transcendent (or extreme) realism associated with Plato. Lewis (1983) criticises arguments for realism, and defends a form of <em>class nominalism</em>, the view that properties are sets of particulars, appealing to his modal realism to distinguish between coextensive properties. Campbell (1981) defends <em>trope theory</em>, the view that properties are abstract particulars, also known as <em>tropes</em>.</p>

Ch. 1 criticises predicate and class nominalism, and suggests the problem of universals can be posed as the problem of specifying what distinguishes the classes that mark off a type from those that do not? Later chapters critically assess attempts to answer this. Maybe set as main core reading alongside later chapter defending realism. 

Ch. 5 defends Aristotelian realism, arguing against Platonic realism, replying along the way to Wittgensteinian family resemblance objections (which he takes to tell against only arguments for abundant ontologies of various sorts, and not his own, relatively sparse ontology). Also argues this and other property theories are committed to states of affairs, with particulars and universals being constituents (and not parts) of these states of affairs. Then argues for his thesis that the world is a world of states of affairs. Distinguishes the concept of a bare particular from that of a thin particular, and argues that THICK particulars are states of affairs. Discusses (and endorses) a conception of properties and relations as ways things ARE, helping to motivate Aristotelian approach. None of it rules out a trope theoretic approach, however. Argues properties, on this approach, are multiply located. More focused on what properties are than whether they exist (which is largely assumed).

<p>In thinking about the topic more, it is worth working through Armstrong (1989). Oliver (1997) is also very helpful, parts of which are reprinted in the editors’ introduction to <a href="#Mellor and Oliver"><b>Mellor and Oliver</b></a>. The central debate is about <em>universals</em>, entities that are numerically identical across their different instances. <em>Realists</em> hold that universals exist, typically arguing that this best explains how different particulars can nevertheless be the same—the same colour, shape, or mass, for example. <em>Nominalists</em>, by contrast, deny that universals exist, arguing that if there is something to be explained here, it can be explained without them. Both realism and nominalism come in different forms. Plato defended an extreme form of realism, <em>transcendent realism</em>, according to which universals stand outside space and time, and can exist uninstantiated; excerpts from his <em>Parmenides</em> and <em>Republic</em> are reprinted in <a href="#Crane and Farkas"><b>Crane and Farkas</b></a>. See also the more recent defences of transcendent realism in the pieces by Russell in <a href="#Mellor and Oliver"><b>Mellor and Oliver</b></a> and in van Inwagen (2004). Armstrong in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>—and in his later (1997)—defends <em>immanent realism</em>, sometimes attributed to Aristotle, on which universals are spatiotemporal entities, and only exist if instantiated. For critical discussion of Armstrong, see Maurin (2015). Among nominalists it is also possible to distinguish extremists, who see no need to explain how different particulars can be the same, from moderates, who think that it can be explained without positing universals. Quine’s ‘On What There Is,’ reprinted in <a href="#Mellor and Oliver"><b>Mellor and Oliver</b></a> (and set as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for <a href="#meta-ontology"><strong>META-ONTOLOGY</strong></a>,) is the <em>locus classicus</em> for extreme nominalism (though terminology is slippery here: Quine there rejects a view he calls nominalism but what is rejecting is the view that there are no abstract objects rather than the view that there are no universals). For more discussion, see also the paper by Jackson and, especially, the debate between Devitt and Armstrong in <a href="#Mellor and Oliver"><b>Mellor and Oliver</b></a>, as well as the more recent Pickel and Mantegani (2012). For moderate nominalism, see, in addition to the <em>class nominalism</em> defended by Lewis in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, the <em>resemblance nominalism</em> defended by Rodriguez-Pereyra (2002). Traditionally, one of the main problems for both has been that of accounting for the possibility of distinct but apparently coextensive properties—the classic example is that of <em>being renate</em> and <em>being cordate</em>. Lewis’s solution appeals to his extreme modal realism, which you’ll have looked at in connection with <a href="#modality"><strong>MODALITY</strong></a>, and is sympathetically discussed in Ch. 5 of Rodriguez-Pereyra (2002). One form of moderate nominalism which escapes the coextension problem is <em>trope theory</em>, which has been much discussed in recent years. In addition to Campbell in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, see the papers by Williams and Daly in <a href="#Mellor and Oliver"><b>Mellor and Oliver</b></a>. (Williams’ paper is also reprinted in <a href="#Crane and Farkas"><b>Crane and Farkas</b></a>.) For a recent critical discussion, see Garcia (2015). For a controversial proposal on how properties are <em>individuated</em>, bearing also on how to draw distinctions between (a) natural and non-natural and (b) intrinsic and extrinsic properties, as well as on issues concerning <a href="#causation"><strong>CAUSATION</strong></a>, see Shoemaker’s paper in <a href="#Mellor and Oliver"><b>Mellor and Oliver</b></a> (also reprinted in both <a href="#Crane and Farkas"><b>Crane and Farkas</b></a> and <a href="#Kim, Korman, and Sosa"><b>Kim, Korman, and Sosa</b></a>). For a radical approach, questioning the particular-universal distinction on which the debate rests, see Macbride (2005), inspired by Ramsey’s paper ‘Universals,’ reprinted in <a href="#Mellor and Oliver"><b>Mellor and Oliver</b></a>.</p>

<!-- Oliver (1996) an advanced overview of the (relatively) recent debate. 

Paul (2002) a form of realism that doesn't fit easily into the transcendent-immanent dichotomy. 

Shoemaker and Quine (Natural Kinds) are both in Kim, Korman, and Sosa.

Williams and Shoemaker also in Crane and Farkas.

Shoemaker:

3. Distinguishes (a) dispositional and non-dispositional PREDICATES, and (b) the powers of a thing from the properties in virtue of which it has them. (These roughly align.)
4. Core thesis: what makes a property the property it is, what deterines its identity, is its potential for contributing to (power to contribute to) the causal powers of the things that have it. [Trilateralness and triangularity may be distinct concepts, but are not distinct properties, Shoemaker suggests.]
5. The argument for the view. [Epistemological.]
6. Suggests a distinction between genuine and merely Cambridge properties.
7. Worries about unavoidable circularities addressed: not aiming at reductive analysis, rather the charting of internal relationships.
8. A very strong consequence: causal necessity is a species of logical (metaphysical) necessity. [This doesn't mean causal laws are analytic or knowable a priori, of course.] Every property is a cluster of conditional powers, but not every cluster of conditional powers is a property. Some lack the required unity. What's the required unity, though? Suggestion: conditional powers X and Y belong to the same property IFF the causal laws are such that (1) whatever has one has the other, or (2) there is some further conditional power such that anything with it has both.
9. Two ways of resisting the very strong consequence, both rejected.
10. Application to Kripke's diagnosis of why we think it's conceivable that heat isn't molecular motion, suggesting it's mistaken.
11. Though radically anti-Humean, the results are in one way Humean: singular causal claims are implicitly general.

Things missed. General discussion of realism: _Swoyer (1999)_. Criticism of Armstrong: _Raven (2022)_ (short, presenting a problem, resting on assumption of grounding, concerning relative priority of universals and states of affairs). Overviews: _Oliver_. 

What about: Hofweber, Trueman? _Effingham_. Also: think carefully about characterisation of transcendent-immanent distinction. Better to avoid talk of space and time here, and stick to talk of whether they exist apart from instances. 

Laurie Paul on Logical Parts, realism that's neither Platonic nor Aristotelian.

Other issues. Bundle theory: later Russell (for), van Cleve (against). Property individuation: Shoemaker, Mellor in **Mellor and Oliver**. Natural vs. non-natural: Quine etc. Intrinsic vs. extrinsic: Lewis etc.

Related issues: dispositions, primary/secondary qualities, meta-ontology (esp. Quinean and truthmaking), truth.

<!-- Classic defence of nominalism, but of what sort? resemblance nominalism. After clarications, presents (and endorses?) the complaint that if (Aristotelian) realism were true, and resemblance were derivative, we'd find much more exact resemblance than we do. Then replies to two objections to resemblance nominalism, "one about 'resemblance in respect of'" and another to the effect "that resemblance itself is a universal", and presents a reply on behalf of realism to the objections raised against it. Suggests, in light of this, that the two are just terminological variants, and realism is misleading.

Lewis (1986) presents his <em>extreme modal realism</em>, according to which modality (and various other notions) are to be explained in terms of possible worlds, these latter being construed in their turn as totalities of spatiotemporally connected entities. Fine (1994) defends <em>essentialism</em>, the view that modality is to be explained in terms of essences rather than, as is standardly assumed, essences in terms of modality. Stalnaker (2009) defends his actualist account of possible worlds as ways things could have been.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-13">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in more depth, the rest of Lewis (1986) is essential. The second chapter defends Lewis’s extreme realism from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. The fourth and final chapter defends counterpart theory, his alternative to the view that there are transworld identities. For a thorough investigation of Lewis’s approach and the various objections that have been raised against it, see Divers (2002). Loux, ed. (1979) is also very useful, collecting together various classic papers. Many of them defend what Vetter (2011) calls <em>classical actualism</em>, agreeing with Lewis that modality is to be explained in terms of possible worlds, but disagreeing with him in holding that possible worlds themselves may be explained in terms of actual entities—propositions (Adams), states of affairs (Plantinga), or properties (Stalnaker), for example. (The paper by Plantinga is also reprinted in <a href="#Crane and Farkas"><b>Crane and Farkas</b></a>, while the paper by Stalnaker is also reprinted in <a href="#Kim, Korman, and Sosa"><b>Kim, Korman, and Sosa</b></a>.) See also the debate in <a href="#Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics"><strong>Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics</strong></a> between Bricker, defending extreme realism, and Melia, defending actualism. Lewis’s claim to have given an account of modality arguably depends on some kind of <em>combinatorialism</em>, a position most closely associated with Armstrong; see, for example, his (1989). Recent years have seen a proliferation of alternative approaches, and you’ll want to think about some of these too. Rosen (1990) defends <em>fictionalism</em>, the view that possible worlds are a useful fiction. Sider (2011) elaborates on the <em>quasi-conventionalism</em> that he sketches towards the end of his (2003) paper. Thomasson (2007) defends a form of <em>non-cognitivism</em> about modality—similar to the non-cognitivism you might already be familiar with from metaethics. Think also about the approaches of <em>new actualists</em>, who seek to explain modality in terms of actual entities, but without appeal to possible worlds. See Vetter (2011), discussing Fine’s <em>essentialist</em> approach as well as her own <em>dispositionalism</em>, for a discussion of some of the issues. Lastly, have a think about the view, defended in Hale (2013), that modality is fundamental and irreducible.</p>

<p>What is McTaggart’s paradox? What, if anything, does it tell us about the nature of time?</p>

<h4 id="core-reading-14">CORE READING</h4>

<p>Start with one or more of the introductory readings, marked with a star (*); then read the unstarred readings, which are more advanced—preferably in the order in which they are listed. McTaggart (1927) argues for the unreality of time, appealing to a distinction between two ways of thinking about events, the A-series and the B-series, and running, very roughly, as follows: time requires change, and change requires an A-series, but the A-series is contradictory, so time is unreal. Broad (1938) presents an interpretation of McTaggart’s rather murky argument against the A-series, and argues that it fails. Prior (1970) briefly defends the main A-theoretic approach, presentism. Mellor (1982) presents a different interpretation of McTaggart’s murky argument against the A-series, and argues that it succeeds.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-14">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Inspired by McTaggart’s distinction between the A-series and the B-series, contemporary debate in the philosophy of time is usually conducted in terms of a distinction between A-theorists, who hold that the passing of time is a genuine, objective feature of reality, and B-theorists, who deny that it is. The main version of the A-theory is presentism, defended by Prior in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>. See also Ingram and Tallant (2018/22), surveying recent work on the view, including the problem of specifying truthmakers for truths concerning the past and the objection that presentism is inconsistent with special relativity. Other versions of the A-theory include the the moving spotlight and growing block views. Both are discussed in Broad (1923), who defends the latter. See also Cameron (2015), a recent defence of the moving spotlight view, and the papers by Correia and Rosenkranz and Braddon-Mitchell in Bennett and Zimmerman, eds. (2014), a recent debate over the growing block view. The B-theory also comes in different varieties, the old and the new theory. The central thesis of the old theory was that tensed sentences, like ‘It was hot yesterday,’ can always be translated into tenseless sentences, like ‘It is hot on the 26th August 2022’ or ‘It is hot on the day preceding the day of this utterance,’ and so—contrary to the claims of A-theorists—don’t ascribe irreducibly temporal properties, like that of being past. Inspired by work in the philosophy of language—in particular, the direct reference theories of indexicals developed by the likes of David Kaplan—proponents of the new theory hold that tensed sentences <em>cannot</em> always be translated into tenseless sentences, but do not ascribe irreducibly temporal properties anyway. Mellor’s work, among others, has been influential here. See Ch. 4 and 5 of his (1981) book, reprinted, alongside various other essays discussing the new approach, in Part I of <a href="#Oaklander and Smith"><b>Oaklander and Smith</b></a>. See also the debate between Smart, another pioneer of the new view, and Zimmerman, a presentist, in <a href="#Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics"><strong>Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics</strong></a>. The other parts of <a href="#Oaklander and Smith"><b>Oaklander and Smith</b></a> are also very useful. Part II reprints various essays discussing two kinds of argument against A-theories, McTaggart’s argument and arguments inspired by problems about the rate at which time passes—see also Prior (1968), a classic A-theoretic response to both—while Part III reprints various essays on something that has become something of a hot topic: temporal experience, and the problems it poses for B-theories. For some more recent discussion of this, try Ismael (2011). The new B-theory, and it’s indexical approach, also raises an interesting interpretive puzzle: what is it that McTaggart thought was special about the temporal case? Why did he show no interest in offering similar paradoxes for the cases of space and person, which also involve indexicals (“here”, “there”, “you”, “I”)? You can think about this more in thinking about the <a href="#change"><strong>THE PROBLEM of CHANGE</strong></a>. See also Dummett (1960), an influential discussion and partial defence of McTaggart’s argument, and Fine (2006), a difficult but rewarding paper on McTaggart offering (among other things) an interesting interpretation of Dummett’s position. Lastly, for another interesting topic in the philosophy of time, have a go at <a href="#time_travel"><strong>TIME TRAVEL</strong></a>.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-15">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Arguably the central divide in the philosophy of causation is the divide between <em>reductionists</em>, holding that causal concepts can be reduced to, or analysed in terms of, non-causal concepts, and <em>non-reductionists</em>, who think that causal concepts cannot be reduced to non-causal concepts. In thinking about the topic more, start with the <em>regularity</em> and <em>counterfactual theories</em>, each taking its cue from a different definition of ‘cause’ offered by Hume in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>. To a first approximation, the regularity theory is the view that C causes E IFF events of the same kind as C are regularly succeeded by events of the same kind as E, though the view is finessed by contemporary proponents of the approach in order to handle various problems. Traditionally, the most pressing of these has been the fact that examples, such as Reid’s of night regularly succeeding day, seem to show that regular succession is not sufficient for causation—see the excerpt from Reid’s <em>Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind</em> in <a href="#Metaphysics: The Big Questions"><b>Metaphysics: The Big Questions</b></a>. 
In the mid twentieth century, a popular solution (offered by many of the logical positivists, for example) was to restrict the relevant regularities to the laws of nature. Depending on how his talk of necessary and sufficient conditions is understood, Mackie, in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, can be seen to be offering another solution. Mackie’s approach is one of the main targets of Lewis’s criticism in his paper in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>. For more critical discussion, see also the papers ‘Defects of the Necessary Condition Analysis of Causation’ and ‘Causes and Events: Mackie on Causation’ by Scriven and Kim respectively in <a href="#Sosa and Tooley"><b>Sosa and Tooley</b></a>. For a more recent defence of Mackie, see Strevens (2007). Also relevant to regularity theories more generally is the paper by Davidson, ‘Causal Relations’, in <a href="#Sosa and Tooley"><b>Sosa and Tooley</b></a>, and reprinted also in both <a href="#Crane and Farkas"><b>Crane and Farkas</b></a> and <a href="#Kim, Korman, and Sosa"><b>Kim, Korman, and Sosa</b></a>. Davidson argues that the causal relata—the entites that stand in relation to one another as cause and effect—are events. Along the way, he distinguishes causation from explanation, and defends regularity theories from the objection that “one-off” instances of causation, like that of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand causing WWI, show that regular succession is not necessary for causation. Counterfactual theories explain causation in terms, not of regularities, but of counterfactuals. Lewis is the most famous proponent of a counterfactual theory, but his views in fact changed over the years. See, in the first instance, ‘Counterfactual Dependence and Time’s Arrow’ and the Postscripts to ‘Causation’ in his (1986) collection. Then see his later paper, ‘Causation as Influence,’ in Collins, Hall, and Paul, eds. (2004)—a collection that contains much else of interest if you’re thinking about counterfactual approaches; see especially the editors’ introduction and the paper by Yablo, ‘Advertisement for a Sketch of an Outline of a Prototheory of Causation,’ defending a variant of Lewis’s original suggestion that causation be understood in terms of counterfactual dependence. See also Menzies and Beebee (2001/19), a useful survey article on work on the counterfactual approach. Beyond the regularity and counterfactual theories, you might want to look at other reductive approaches, less Humean in outlook. For discussion of the prospects for a probablistic approach, see Salmon’s paper ‘Probablistic Causality’ in <a href="#Sosa and Tooley"><b>Sosa and Tooley</b></a> and Hitchcock’s (1997/2018) survey piece for the <em>Stanford Encylopedia</em>—useful, among other things, for its overview of the causal modelling literature. For process theories, see Salmon’s other contribution to <a href="#Sosa and Tooley"><b>Sosa and Tooley</b></a>, ‘Causality: Production and Propagation,’ and Dowe’s piece, ‘Causal Process Theories,’ in Beebee, Hitchcock, and Menzies, eds. (2009)—a relatively recent state of the art collection containing many useful survey pieces. For proponents of non-reductionism, the main obstacle is Hume’s argument from empiricism against the traditional view that causes in some way necessitate their effects. While some non-reductionists reject Hume’s empiricism altogether, taking the Kantian line that causation is an <em>a priori</em> concept, analogous to entailment, most accept empiricism in some form, arguing either that causal relations are observable or that, while they cannot be observed, they can be inferred. For an example of the former approach, see Anscombe’s classic paper, ‘Causality and Determination,’ reprinted in <a href="#Sosa and Tooley"><b>Sosa and Tooley</b></a> as well as <a href="#Kim, Korman, and Sosa"><b>Kim, Korman, and Sosa</b></a> and <a href="#Metaphysics: The Big Questions"><b>Metaphysics: The Big Questions</b></a>. For an example of the latter, see Tooley’s ‘Causation: Reduction versus Realism,’ also in <a href="#Sosa and Tooley"><b>Sosa and Tooley</b></a> as well as <a href="#Kim, Korman, and Sosa"><b>Kim, Korman, and Sosa</b></a>. Beyond reductionism and non-reductionism, think also about the eliminativist approach of Russell (1912/13) and the anti-realist approach of Menzies and Price (1993). An important recent development, officially non-reductionist, but drawing on counterfactual approaches, Menzies and Price’s anti-realism, and the causal modelling literature, is Woodward’s interventionism. Its roots lie in the agentialist approach defended by von Wright in his piece, ‘On the Logic and Epistemology of the Causal Relation,’ in <a href="#Sosa and Tooley"><b>Sosa and Tooley</b></a>, but the best place to start is probably Woodward’s (2001/16) survey paper for the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia</em>.</p>

Ofra: Qualitative vs. numerical identity. Leibniz's law (both parts): whether the latter part's controversial or not depends on whether it's restricted to purely qualitative properties or not. (Max Black.) But even the first part seems to have surprising consequences: statue isn't lump (material constitution); tall flower isn't short flower (problem of change). 

Transitivity of identity. Apparent counter-examples: ship 1 = ship 2, and ship 1 = ship 3, but ship 1 ≠ ship 3 (ship of theseus); original is lefty, and original is righty, but lefty ≠ righty (fission). Solve these by appeal to vague identity? ship 1 only vaguely identical to ship 2 (so no counter-example to LL). But LL rules out vague identity.

How to react? Set aside rejecting LL (e.g. if you want to, see literature on relative identity). Option 1: bite the bullet (e.g. statue ≠ clay, or more drastically tall flower ≠ short flower). How do we do that in transitivity cases -- do we reject A=B or A=C (or B≠C!), and why? 

Option 2: deny validity by denying we've got an application of LL. How? Predictional shift strategy (predicate 'F' changes meaning in premises: flower is short-at-t1 and not short-at-t2). Referential shift strategy (name 'a' changes meaning in premises: ship 1a is ship 2, and ship 1b = 3). 

Option 3: accept validity but deny a premise (e.g. insist lump is Romanesque, or statue does exist before it becomes a statue).

<p>Under what conditions do some things <em>compose</em> a thing, i.e. constitute the parts of that thing?</p>

<h4 id="core-reading-17"> CORE READING</h4>

<p>Read one or more of the introductory pieces, marked with a star (*). Then read each of the unstarred pieces, which are more advanced. Van Inwagen (1990) raises the special composition question and argues for <em>organicism</em>, the view that some things compose a thing only if the latter is a living organism. It is thus a form of <em>eliminativism</em>, holding that many of the objects we ordinarily take to exist, like tables and chairs, do <em>not</em> exist. Sider (2001) gives an argument from vagueness for <em>universalism</em>, the view that, for any things whatsoever, there is a thing composed of them. Hirsch (2002) presents an argument from charity against more revisionary ontologies like van Inwagen’s and Sider’s, and for <em>conservatism</em>, the view that the composite things are by and large the ones we pretheoretically suppose them to be.</p>

<!--Universalists typically *reductionists* about ordinary objects, holding that ordinary objects, like tables and chairs, just are suitably arranged collections of simples. But they needn't be: ordinary objects could stand in a special relation to their parts, e.g of being *constituted* by them.-->

<p>Read one or more of the introductory pieces, marked with a star (*). Then read each of the more advanced, unstarred pieces. Mellor (1981) defends a <em>relational</em> account of change in response to McTaggart’s objections that it (a) reduces change to changeless facts and (b) is unable to account for the difference between change and spatial variation. Lewis (1986) criticises this and other accounts as inadequate responses to what he calls the problem of <em>temporary intrinsics</em>, a problem that has come to dominate contemporary discussion of the problem of change. Haslanger (2003) carefully lays out the moving parts of the problem of temporary intrinsics, and goes on to defend <em>adverbialism</em> as a solution.</p>

Something introductory, focusing on problems of change. Then:

Lewis.
Something endurantist.
Something exdurantist.
And since Lewis is short, something else, too, casting doubt on the problem?

In the Further Reading, explain that the idea that there's a problem here is ancient: Parmenides. But sense that it's spurious, too: Aristotle. 

Engaging with Lewis: Johnston, Haslanger, Hawley, also Langton and Lewis (on intrinsics). Many of these in H&K.

Defences of endurantism that deny temporal parts: Wiggins, also Van Inwagen.

Then people like Hawthorne denying that the question's really about temporal parts. Also: Hofweber, Einheuser, Magidor.

Look also at **MATERIAL CONSTITUTION**.


Zimmerman: A-theoretic reply

**Lewis: temporal parts a/c
McTaggart: against temporal parts a/c
Sider: defending temporal parts a/c

Mellor, Ch. 8: time-indexed properties
Lewis, Tensing: against time-indexed properties (temp intrinsics)
Wasserman: on temp intrinsics
**Haslanger, Endurance: on temp intrinsics
Parsons, Must a 4Dist: on temp intrinsics

Johnston: adverbialism, relativising the HAVING of properties
Lewis, Tensing: against adverbialism (Bradley's regress)

Hofweber: radical nominalism (no properties, so no problem)
MacBride: trope theoretic (and other approaches - also Ehring, Simons)

To at least a first approximation, the problem of change arises out of the fact that we understand persistence through change to be a matter of one and the same object having incompatible properties. Yet no object *can* have incompatible properties. Isn't persistence through change, as we understand it, therefore impossible? Standard responses to the problem accept that no object can have incompatible properties, but insist that this can be reconciled with a correct understanding of persistence through change. Different theorists attempt the reconciliation in different ways, however, offering more or less revisionary accounts of persistence through change: perdurantists, like Lewis, argue that it is a matter of one and the same object having different *temporal parts* with incompatible properties; exdurantists (also known as stage theorists), like Sider, argue that it is a matter of different *temporal counterparts* having incompatible properties; while endurantists, like Haslanger, argue (roughly) that it is a matter of one and the same object having incompatible properties itself but at different *times*. **H&K** contains many classic papers on the issues, usefully arranged into thematic groups. **Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics** is also useful, containing a paper by Sider defending exdurantism and a paper by Hawthorne attacking the idea that the debate should be regarded as one about whether or not temporal parts (or counterparts) exist. See also Macbride (2001), arguing that the debate overlooks various alternative accounts of change; Koslicki (2003), on Sider's argument from vagueness; and Magidor (2016), arguing that a host of argument offered in the literature are strictly orthogonal to the debate between endurantists and perdurantists. You might also want to think about overlap between this topic and **OBJECTS**. See, e.g., McGrath (2007) on the argument from coincidence or co-location. Lastly, you might want to think about some non-standard responses to the problem. Priest (2006) argues there are good reasons for thinking change produces *dialethias*, or true contradictions, while Hofweber (2009) and Einheuser (2012) argue there's no real problem of change in the first place, only a *meta*-problem.

<p>Can multiple objects occupy exactly the same region of space at exactly the same time? If so, how?</p>

<h4 id="core-reading-19"> CORE READING</h4>

<p>Read one or more of the introductory pieces, marked with a star (*). Then read each of the more advanced, unstarred pieces. Wiggins (1968) is a short piece, arguing that, while two object <em>of the same kind</em> cannot occupy the same region of space at exactly the same time, two objects of <em>different</em> kinds, such  that one of the objects is <em>constituted</em> by the other, as in the case of a statue and the piece of clay from which it is made, can. Gibbard (1975) attacks a key assumption of this, arguing that a statue and the piece of clay from which it is made can be contingently identical, responding along the way to the objection that the statue and the piece of clay from which it is made differ in their modal properties, and so, by the indiscernibility of identicals, must be distinct. Thomson (1998) argues, against Gibbard and with Wiggins, that the statue and the piece of clay are distinct, and offers an account of constitution.</p>

#### FURTHER READING

If you're working on this topic in more depth, Locke's discussion in his *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (Bk II, Ch. 27) is essential reading, as are the famous replies from Thomas Reid and Joseph Butler. These are usefully collected, along with various other pieces, in Perry, ed. (2008). You'll also want to think a bit about Williams. For some discussion, see the piece by Nozick in **M&B**, Noonan (1982), and John Perry's piece ‘Williams on The Self and the Future’ in Perry, ed. (2008). Otherwise, you should focus on Parfit and animalism. **M&B** contains a number of pieces discussing Parfit: those by Lewis, Korsgaard, Unger, Sosa, Martin, Schechtman, and Johnston, as well as Parfit's own 'The Unimportance of Identity'. Lewis's response is particularly important, and will seem less *ad hoc* if you've encountered his views on persistence more generally. For discussion of animalism, you'll have to look elsewhere. Snowdon (1990) is an important statement and defence of the position. For other discussions, see Olson (2004), Shoemaker (2008), Madden (2011), and the collection, Blatti and Snowdon, eds. (2016)&mdash;the last containing a piece by Parfit arguing against animalism. For a recent book on personal identity, aimed at undergraduates, try Kind (2015).

Another thing to think about is time travel. Is it possible? Does it pose a problem for particular views about time? Lewis (1976) is a classic, arguing that it's possible. And see Vihvelin (1996) for discussion, and Wasserman (2017) for a recent book on the topic.

Can we travel back in time? Can we change the past? Would time travel constrain our ability to control the future? Does time travel give us extra ways to control the future?

#### FURTHER READING  

In working further on this topic, you could do worse than work through the chapters of Part 2 of Berto and Plebani (2015), looking more closely at individual papers defending the views they discuss. Try the paper by Kris McDaniels in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009) for an example of the Ontological Pluralism discussed in Ch. 4, and Linnebo (2012) for an example of Neo-Fregeanism. For the Neo-Carnapianism discussed in Ch. 5, try Hirsch (2002), Thomas Hofweber's paper in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), and Thomasson (2008). Fictionalism, discussed in Ch. 8 of Berto and Plebani (2015), is defended by Stephen Yablo in the piece above. For Meinongianism, discussed in Ch. 7, start with Reicher (2006/19). Fine (2012) is an example of the Grounding Approach discussed in Ch. 8. You'll find other various useful papers in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), along with a handy editors' introduction. Two other recommendations: Lewis and Lewis (1970), a dialogue between two philosophers discussing whether there are holes, is a must-read, while Effingham (2013) is a fantastic introductory book, aimed at undergraduates and discussing issues of meta-ontology in relation to debates in specific areas of metaphysics. It can be profitably read in working further not just on meta-ontology, but also on topics such as [**POSSIBLE WORLDS**](#possible_worlds), [**TIME**](#time), and [**PERSISTENCE**](#persistence).
