<h1 id="philosophy-of-mind">Philosophy of Mind</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Mind. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. We start with the mind-body problem, looking at type-identity theories, functionalism, consciousness, and zombies. We then look at some issues in the epistemology of mind, self-knowledge and other minds, before finishing off with a look at core issues in the philosophy of perception and the philosophy of action. The plan is not set in stone, however, and I’ve also listed a range of <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. If you want to cover some of these instead, let me know, and I’ll see what we can do. Note that topics you may have covered in studying General Philosophy or Knowledge and Reality, and so might want to leave for self-study later, are marked with a dagger (†).</p>

<p>The reading for each topic is divided into two parts. In writing your tutorial essay, focus on the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, using as a guide the more introductory texts marked with a star (*) and any Faculty lectures on the topic—the lectures may be available online via <a href="http://www.canvas.ox.ac.uk/">Canvas</a>, and are a good indication of what might come up in the exams. You can then look at the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> as well as anything else on the Faculty Reading List (email me for this) when exploring topics in more depth during later vacations.</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Philosophy of Mind to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. If you’d like to use the list for teaching, please feel free. Feedback and corrections are gratefully received!</p>

<p>These can be profitably read both as preparation beforehand and as guides and consolidation during and after your tutorial work, but they are no substitute for any of the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> suggested below. To do well in any philosophy paper, you have to work through the details.</p>

<h4 id="anthologies-and-collections">ANTHOLOGIES and COLLECTIONS</h4>

<p>While most of the readings can be obtained online, it’s often useful to have good anthologies and collections of papers in the philosophy of mind, so as to be able to read around a bit more widely. The following are recommended, containing many of the suggested readings, and are referenced below:</p>

<h4 id="essay-question">ESSAY QUESTION</h4>

<p>What is the type-identity theory, and what is the best argument for it? What is the multiple realizability argument against the theory? Is it decisive? Are any other arguments against the theory decisive?</p>

<h4 id="core-reading">CORE READING</h4>

<p>Start with any of the introductory readings marked with a star (*)—you needn’t read them all now, but come back later in revision to anything you have missed. Then move on to the unstarred readings, which are more advanced. Smart (1959) is a classic, offering an argument from parsimony for the theory, and defending it from various objections. Lewis (1966) offers another, especially influential argument for the theory. Putnam (1967) raises the multiple realizability objection against the theory.</p>

<p>For a causal argument for the type-identity theory, related to issues about <a href="#mental_causation"><strong>MENTAL CAUSATION</strong></a>, see Papineau (2002). You will think more about Lewis’s views in doing <a href="#functionalism"><strong>FUNCTIONALISM</strong></a>. After doing so, come back and take a look at Lewis (1980), his response to the multiple realizability objection, and Lewis (1995), discussing multiple realizability but also providing a useful summary of his views in the philosophy of mind more generally. For other responses to the multiple realizability objection, see Kim (1992) and Bechtel and Mundale (1999). For a defence of the objection, written by one of its original proponents, see Fodor (1997). Polger and Shapiro (2016) is a recent book, and Bickle (1998/2013) a useful survey. For more on Max Black’s objection to the type-identity theory—discussed by Smart in his paper, and related to issues you can explore in thinking about <a href="#consciousness"><strong>CONSCIOUSNESS</strong></a>—try Block (2006). For Kripke’s modal objection to the type- (and token-) identity theories, see <a href="#modal_arguments"><strong>MODAL ARGUMENTS</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Putnam was an early proponent of functionalism. In addition to his (1967) paper from last week, see his (1975), distancing himself from the machine functionalism of the earlier paper, but defending the idea that functional isomorphism is key to “unravelling the mysteries in the philosophy of mind”. For more on how to formulate functionalism, see Shoemaker (1981) and Block (1996). For more on absent qualia, see Schwitzgebel (2015), arguing that Block’s example of an artificial body controlled by the population of China, communicating in a way that functionally duplicates the neurons of a brain, would have mental states with qualia, and Lewis (1980), listed as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for last week’s topic, <a href="#type-identity"><strong>TYPE-IDENTITY</strong></a>. For more on inverted qualia, see Nida-Rümelin (1996) and Byrne (2004/20). For the worry that  functionalism cannot accommodate the rationalizing role of mental states, see McDowell (1985) and Heal (1986). For an argument from self-consciousness against functionalism, see Bealer (1997).</p>

Then move on to the unstarred readings, which are more advanced. Nagel (1974) is one of the most cited papers in the philosophy of mind, arguing that consciousness cannot be explained in physical terms. Jackson (1982) and (1986) present his influential knowledge argument against physicalism (and for qualia). Dennett (1988) argues that conscious experiences do not have qualia, at least as the latter are ordinarily understood.</p>

<p>Various arguments against physicalism rest on the idea that conscious experiences and sensations have phenomenal properties. This week our focus is on two, broadly epistemological arguments, the explanatory gap and knowledge arguments; we turn next week to look at the more metaphysical <a href="#modal_arguments"><strong>MODAL ARGUMENTS</strong></a> of Kripke and Chalmers. In working more on the knowledge argument, <a href="LNS"><b>LNS</b></a> is a very useful resource, collecting together a range of key works, including Lewis (1988), defending the ability hypothesis. See also Tye (2000), criticising Lewis’s strategy, and defending the alternative phenomenal concepts approach. This is criticised in turn by Chalmers in a paper specially written for <a href="LNS"><b>LNS</b></a>, ‘Phenomenal Concepts and the Knowledge Argument’. See also Nida-Rümelin and O Conaill (2002/19), a comprehensive overview of the debate over the knowledge argument. Key papers on the explanatory gap include McGinn (1989) and Chalmers (1995). For a relatively short piece criticising both arguments, as well as last week’s absent qualia argument, see Van Gulick (1993). See also Shoemaker (1991), attempting to reject Dennett-style eliminativism about qualia whilst defending functionalism and materialism. For an important attempt to demystify consciousness, the influential higher-order thought (HOT) approach, see Rosenthal (1986). For critical discussion of the HOT approach, see Block (2011).</p>

<p>Start with any of the introductory readings marked with a star (*)—you needn’t read them all now, but come back later in revision to anything you have missed. Then move on to the unstarred readings, which are more advanced. Kripke (1980), building on material in the philosophy of language in the earlier lectures, presents an argument against type- and token-identity theories. Chalmers (1996) presents a variation of the argument, targeting materialism more generally. Hill (1997) argues against a key plank of both arguments, namely an assumption connecting conceivability with possibility.</p>

<p>Levine (1983) is an important discussion of Kripke’s argument, arguing that it at least demonstrates an explanatory gap. Bealer (1994) defends a version of the argument, arguing that it favourably compares with the multiple realizability argument, the argument from doubt, and the knowledge argument, and that, suitably adapted, goes through. Shoemaker (2011) is a relatively recent discussion of the argument. For more on whether zombies are conceivable, see Kirk (2008). For more on the inference from their conceivability to their possibility, see various of the papers in Gendler and Hawthorne, eds. (2002) and Byrne (2007), arguing that it doesn’t play a role in Kripke’s argument. One important response here, relevant also to last week’s topic, appeals to the phenomenal concepts strategy. Tye took this approach in his (2000) book, listed as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> last week, but later abandoned it. See his (2009). See the various papers in Alter and Walter, eds. (2006), a collection focusing on the strategy, and Balog (2012), a recent defence of it. Chalmers responds to objections and develops his views in various papers in his (2010) collection. See especially Parts III and IV. For the suggestion that modal arguments tell in favour of pan-psychism, the view that matter is conscious, see Mørch (2017).</p>

<p>The classic contemporary discussion of the inner-sense approach is Armstrong (1993), though it goes back to Locke. Kind (2003) responds to Shoemaker (1994) in its defence. For the acquaintance approach, which goes back to Russell and, before him, Descartes, see Gertler’s contribution to Smithies and Stoljar, eds. (2012). Byrne’s transparency-based approach builds on themes in Evans (1982). For critical discussion, see Boyle (2011). See also the contrasting agentialist approaches of McGeer (1996) and Moran (2001). Moran’s approach is particularly influential, and critically discussed in O’Brien (2003). See also the papers by Byrne and Moran in Smithies and Stoljar, eds. (2012). For Shoemaker’s positive view, constitutivism, see Lecture III of his (1994) and the papers in Part III of Smithies and Stoljar, eds. (2012). For a recent defence of something like expressivism, see Campbell (2020). For a textbook on the issues, expanding on her SEP entry on the topic, see Gertler (2011). Other issues to think about include the sense, if any, in which the knowledge one gains by introspection is epistemologically special—for this, see the entry on <a href="http://jonnymcintosh.com/syllabuses/102/#self-knowledge"><strong>SELF-KNOWLEDGE</strong></a> for <strong>KNOWLEDGE &amp; REALITY</strong>—and the question of how, if at all, such knowledge can be reconciled with <a href="#externalism"><strong>EXTERNALISM about MENTAL CONTENT</strong></a>.</p>

<p>What is the epistemological or traditional problem of other minds? What is the conceptual problem? Which, if either, is the more fundamental problem? And how, if at all, are they to be solved?</p>

<h4 id="core-reading-5">CORE READING</h4>

<p>Start with any of the introductory readings marked with a star (*)—you needn’t read them all now, but come back later in revision to anything you have missed. Then move on to the unstarred readings, which are more advanced. Strawson (1958) is a classic discussion of—and sketch of a solution to—the conceptual problem. Pargetter (1984) is a short piece, defending an inference to the best explanation approach to the epistemological problem—an approach criticised in Melnyk (1994), another short piece (together they come to seventeen pages). Cassam (2007) defends the perceptual approach.</p>

For discussion, sympathetic to Strawson, see also Avramides (2001). Discussion of the conceptual problem is often influenced by Wittgenstein. See especially §§253-352 of Part I and §iv of Part II of his <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. See also Kripke (1982). Contemporary discussions of other minds tends to focus more on the traditional epistemological problem. Ayer (1953) is a classic statement of the issues. See also Putnam (1975) and Sober (2000). For recent discussion of the perceptual approach, see McNeill (2012) and Parrott (2017).</p>

For responses to these, see Dorsch (2010) and Siegel’s contribution to Nanay, ed. (2010). For more on disjunctivism, see in the first instance <a href="#Byrne and Logue"><strong>Byrne and Logue</strong></a>, which contains a wealth of important papers, including pioneering work by J. M. Hinton. For critical discussion of disjunctivism, see Burge (2005) and Nudds (2009). For discussion and replies to these criticisms, see in the first instance the later parts of Soteriou (2016). For an overview of work on the content of perception, see Siegel (2015). One issue here, which you can explore in more depth in thinking about <strong>CONSCIOUSNESS and CONTENT</strong>, is the extent to which the phenomenal character of perceptual experience is determined by intrinsic, non-intentional qualities of the experience, or <em>qualia</em>. Papineau (2014) defends an extreme view, opposed to both intentionalism and disjunctivism, on which the phenomenal character of perceptual experience is <em>wholly</em> determined by such qualia. For some introductory discussion of Papineau’s view, and much more besides, take a look at Pautz (2021).</p>

Explain and assess (i) Anscombe's thesis that intentional actions are “to which a certain sense of the question ‘Why?’ is given application; the sense is of course that in which the answer, if positive, gives a reason for acting” and (ii) Davidson's thesis that rationalising explanations are causal explanations.-->

Then move on to the unstarred readings, which are more advanced. Davidson (1963) is a classic, defending the thesis that rationalising explanations are causal explanations. Wilson (1985) criticises Davidson’s thesis, defending an alternative, teleological approach to rationalising explanations. Dancy (2000) criticises Davidson’s thesis, building on an argument developed earlier in the book against psychologism about reasons.</p>

<p>This week’s topic has connections to a number of others, especially <a href="#anomalous_monism"><strong>ANOMALOUS MONISM</strong></a> and <a href="mental_causation"><strong>MENTAL CAUSATION</strong></a>. For defence of Davidson’s causalism, responding to both teleologists, like Wilson, and Dancy, see Mele (2003). See also Setiya (2011), offering an alternative line of argument for causalism. For naive action theory, see Thompson (2008) and Marcus (2012), the latter criticising both Davidson and his anti-causalist opponents. See also Hyman (2015), also critical of Davidson and anti-causalism alike, Löhrer and Sehon (2016), a recent defence of the teleological approach, and various of the papers in D’Oro and Sandis, eds. (2013)—particularly D’Oro and Sandis’s ‘From Anti-causalism to Causalism and Back: A History of the Reasons/Causes Debate’ and McLaughlin’s criticism of causalism, ‘Why Rationalization Is Not a Species of Causal Explanation’. As a classic of modern philosophy of action, Davidson’s (1963) paper is rivalled perhaps only by Anscombe (1957), who argues, among other things, that intentional actions are those “to which a certain sense of the question ‘Why?’ is given application; the sense is of course that in which the answer, if positive, gives a reason for acting”. Her discussion of this is quite hard going, but well worth the effort. Schwenkler (2019) is a useful guide. Note that Anscombe’s question, of what it is for an action to be intentional, is not the same as the question of how rationalising explanations of action relate to causal explanations. In her (1957), she remains neutral on the latter question, though she later argued against causalism. Davidson’s views on the former is informed by his views on the latter. Roughly put, he holds that intentional actions are those that are caused in the right way by the agent’s pro-reasons. The key papers are reprinted in the <em>Intention and Action</em> section of his (2001)—see especially ‘Agency’ and ‘How is Weakness of the Will Possible?’. For more on the general topic of what it is for an action to be intentional, see <a href="#action"><strong>ACTION and AGENCY</strong></a>.</p>

For an alternative defence of causalism, see Child (1994). For naive action theory, Thompson (2008). Though they are related, the question how rationalising explanations of action relate to causal explanations should be distinguished from the question of what makes an action intentional. For the latter topic, see [**ACTION and AGENCY**](#action).

#### ESSAY QUESTION

What is anomalous monism? What is Davidson’s argument for it? In particular, what reason, if any, is there for thinking that the mental is anomalous? Can anomalous monism avoid epiphenomenalism?

#### FURTHER READING  
Other essential papers by Davidson on this topic include his (1974) and (1995). And you'll find much of interest besides Kim's paper in Part III of Ernie Lepore and Brian McLaughlin, eds. (1985) <i>Actions and Events: Perspectives on the Philosophy of Donald Davidson</i> (Blackwell). Particularly recommended are McLaughlin's introduction, and the papers by Horgan and Tye, Hornsby, Johnston, and McDowell. McDowell's paper is particularly important if you're thinking about what the argument for the anomalousness of the mental might be. On that issue, see also Tiffany (2001), which critically discusses Kim, McDowell, and Child. For Davidson's response to the charge of epiphenomenalism, see his contribution, 'Thinking Causes', to Heil and Mele, eds. (1993). The other papers in Part I of this volume are replies to Davidson, and are well worth reading, particularly Kim's. For more recent work on the issue, try Heil (2009). Also of relevance here is an issue of interpretation. The standard take on Davidson's anomalous monism is that it's a form of non-reductive physicalism. In a series of papers, Frederick Stoutland has argued that this is a mistake, and that it's ontologically neutral, more akin to the sort of view that can be found in Spinoza. See, for example, Stoutland (2011). <!--For another introductory discussion of anomalous monism, see Ch. 8 of the book by Marc Joseph listed in the Further Reading for [**ACTION EXPLANATION**](#action_explanation). 

Yalowitz (2005/12) is perhaps a bit too advanced to count as introductory, but it is a useful survey and a good source for further references.

Kim responds to Block in his (2005). For critical discussion of Jackson and Pettit's program model, see Menzies (2007). For critical discussion of Yablo's account of mental causation, see Funkhouser (2006). For some alternative responses to the exclusion problem, see Bennett (2003), Gibbons (2006), and Árnadóttir and Crane (2013)&mdash;the last a nice, relatively recent paper, arguing that the exclusion principle can be rejected without appeal to any heavy-duty assumptions about the metaphysics of causation. Robb and Heil's (2003/18) entry for the *Stanford Encyclopedia* is a survey piece discussing the exclusion problem and various other problems concerning mental causation. You'll have looked at one of these when studying [**ANOMALOUS MONISM**](#anomalous_monism), and will look at another next week on [**EXTERNALISM about MENTAL CONTENT**](#externalism).

<p>Is the best formulation of physicalism that worlds which are alike in physical facts are alike in mental facts? (2021)</p>

<p>An argument against physicalism is that it leaves out the qualitative side of our mental life. Consider one such argument from the literature, and say whether you think that argument should be given a metaphysical reading or an epistemological reading. (2020)</p>

<p>‘The mere claim of mind-body supervenience leaves unaddressed the question what grounds or accounts for it.’ (JAEGWON KIM) If this is true, what should physicalists do? (2019)</p>
