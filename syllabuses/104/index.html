<h1 id="philosophy-of-mind">Philosophy of Mind</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Mind. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. We start with the mind-body problem, looking at type-identity theories, functionalism, and zombies. We then look at some issues in the epistemology of mind, other minds and self-knowledge, before finishing off with a look at perception, the explanation of action, and the debate between internalists and externalists about mental content. The plan is not set in stone, however, and I have also listed a range of <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. If you want to cover one of these instead, let me know, and I’ll see what we can do. Note that topics you may have covered in first year General Philosophy or in studying for Knowledge and Reality, and so might want to leave for self-study in vacations, are marked with a dagger (†).</p>

<p>The reading for each topic is divided into two parts. In writing your tutorial essay, focus on the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, using as a guide the more introductory texts marked with a star (*) and any Faculty lectures on the topic—the lectures may be available online via <a href="http://www.canvas.ox.ac.uk/">Canvas</a>, and are a good indication of what might come up in the exams. You can then look at the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> as well as anything else on the Faculty Reading List (email me for this) when exploring topics in more depth during later vacations.</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Philosophy of Mind to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. If you’d like to use the list for teaching, please feel free. Feedback and corrections are gratefully received!</p>

<p>If you are thinking about whether to take Philosophy of Mind, or have decided to do so and want to do some preliminary reading over the vacation beforehand, take a look at some of the following textbooks:</p>

<p>These can be profitably read both as preparation beforehand and as guides and consolidation during and after your tutorial work, but they are no substitute for the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> suggested below. To do well in any philosophy paper, you have to work through the details.</p>

<h4 id="anthologies-and-collections">ANTHOLOGIES and COLLECTIONS</h4>

<p>While most of the readings can be obtained online, it’s often useful to have good anthologies and collections of papers in epistemology and metaphysics, so as to be able to read around a bit more widely. The following are all recommended, containing many of the key readings and more besides, and are referenced below:</p>

<p>An argument against physicalism is that it leaves out the qualitative side of our mental life. Consider one such argument from the literature, and say whether you think that argument should be given a metaphysical reading or an epistemological reading. (2020)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) Why might one think that an intuition of contingency can be explained away in cases such as ‘Heat might not be molecular motion’ but not in cases such as ‘Pain might not be C-fibre firing’? What does that tell us about the mind?<br />

<p>For a classic presentation of the suggestion that there is a distinctive epistemological problem of other minds, concerning a contrast between how we know about our own minds and how we know about others’—what Gomes (2018) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> calls the <em>problem of sources</em>—see Ayers (1953). One response to it, offered by the likes of Mill and Russell, is to argue that our knowledge of other minds is based on an <em>inference</em> of some sort. For a recent discussion of this approach, try (2000). For classic criticism of it, see Putnam (1975). <!--Hyslop and Jackson (1972) is a classic defence of this sort of approach. For a more recent discussion, try Sober (2000). -->Another response is to argue our knowledge of other minds is <em>perceptual</em>. For discussion and defence of this approach, see McNeill (2012). For criticism, see McGinn (1984) and Parrott (2017).

For more on disjunctivism, see the various papers in <a href="#Byrne and Logue"><b>Byrne and Logue</b></a>. For some critical discussion, start with Nudds (2009), then go on to Soteriou (2016), an excellent overview of the debates over disjunctivism. For a defence of sense data that doesn’t appeal to arguments from illusion and hallucination, see Jackson (1977). For the qualia view, see Block (2003). Pautz (2021) is a good, recent, and accessible introduction to the general topic.</p>

(b) ‘The employment of our ordinary, full-blooded concepts of physical objects is indispensable to a strict, and strictly veridical, account of our sensible experience.’ (STRAWSON) What consequences does this observation have for theories of perception? (2017)</p>

<!--
Does the phenomenal character of visual experiences supervene on their representational contents? (2017) 

‘One may be seeing a scene, and yet the scene looks some way that it isn’t. To accommodate this, it seems that we have to posit that visual perceptual experience has a representational content.’ (McLAUGHLIN) Discuss. (2016)  

To the extent that perceptual experience is transparent, what does this tell us about the nature of perceptual experience? (2015)

**EITHER**  
(a) What, if anything, can we conclude about the nature of perception from the fact that seeing the cup on the table is subjectively indistinguishable from hallucinating a cup on the table?  
**OR**  
(b) ‘When I say “this table appears brown to me” it is quite plain that I am acquainted with an actual instance of brownness.’ (PRICE) Discuss. (2014)  

‘Perception is, at root, a way of finding out about the world.’ What are the implications for philosophical accounts of perception? (2013)  

**EITHER**

<p>The original targets of Davidson (1963) were a series of so-called “little red books” published by Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul in the 1960s. See, for example, Melden (1961). For recent discussion and defence of something like their approach, see Tanney (2009). For critical discussion of Wilson and Dancy from a causalist perspective, see Ch. 2 and 3 respectively of Mele (2003). For the latest in an ongoing debate between Mele and Sehon, a prominent defender of the teleological approach, see Sehon (2016), Löhrer and Sehon (2016), and Mele (2019). For an alternative defence of causalism, see Child (1994). For naive action theory, Thompson (2008). Though they are related, the question how rationalising explanations of action relate to causal explanations should be distinguished from the question of what makes an action intentional. For the latter topic, see <a href="#action"><strong>ACTION and AGENCY</strong></a>.</p>

<!--
Shoemaker holds that the beliefs expressed by first-personal psychological statements are not based on the basis of criteria. Rather, there's no difference between one's being in a given mental state and one's believing that one is. 

This explains why the beliefs expressed by first-personal psychological statements are not simply *generally* true but are, he thinks, *always* true. Moreover, it explains why, unlike other things we know, which we can learn in other ways, we can ONLY learn about our mental states by being aware of them.

What, if anything, is distinctive about *self-knowledge*, i.e. one's knowledge of one's own mental states? Why is self-knowledge distinctive in this way?

<!--

#### ESSAY QUESTION

Is self-knowledge a form of perceptual knowledge? If not, how is it obtained?

<h4 id="further-reading-7">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>Other essential papers by Davidson on this topic include his (1974) and (1995). And you’ll find much of interest besides Kim’s paper in Part III of Ernie Lepore and Brian McLaughlin, eds. (1985) <i>Actions and Events: Perspectives on the Philosophy of Donald Davidson</i> (Blackwell). Particularly recommended are McLaughlin’s introduction, and the papers by Horgan and Tye, Hornsby, Johnston, and McDowell. McDowell’s paper is particularly important if you’re thinking about what the argument for the anomalousness of the mental might be. On that issue, see also Tiffany (2001), which critically discusses Kim, McDowell, and Child. For Davidson’s response to the charge of epiphenomenalism, see his contribution, ‘Thinking Causes’, to Heil and Mele, eds. (1993). The other papers in Part I of this volume are replies to Davidson, and are well worth reading, particularly Kim’s. For more recent work on the issue, try Heil (2009). Also of relevance here is an issue of interpretation. The standard take on Davidson’s anomalous monism is that it’s a form of non-reductive physicalism. In a series of papers, Frederick Stoutland has argued that this is a mistake, and that it’s ontologically neutral, more akin to the sort of view that can be found in Spinoza. See, for example, Stoutland (2011). <!--For another introductory discussion of anomalous monism, see Ch. 8 of the book by Marc Joseph listed in the Further Reading for [**ACTION EXPLANATION**](#action_explanation). -->Yalowitz (2005/12) is perhaps a bit too advanced to count as introductory, but it is a useful survey and a good source for further references.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-9">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Very crudely, Kripke’s challenge revolves around two claims, first, that the relevant identities—e.g. that pain is the firing of c-fibres—are false if it is possible for them to be false, and second, that it <em>is</em> possible for them to be false. The first claim is widely accepted, though see Lewis (1980) and (1995), listed in the Further Reading for <a href="#type-identity"><strong>TYPE-IDENTITY THEORIES</strong></a> for a dissenting voice. Most of the discussion focuses on the second claim, and in particular whether or not the fact that we can, in some sense, imagine or conceive of the relevant identities being false gives us a good reason to think that it is possible for them to be false. Yablo (1993) is a classic discussion of the connection between conceivability and possibility. See also Gendler and Hawthorne, eds. (2004), especially the extremely useful editors’ introduction—§3 of which offers a nice introduction to Kripke’s argument and some of the technical concepts that figure in it—and the papers by Bealer, Chalmers, Wright, and Yablo. And see Byrne (2007) for argument to the effect that the focus on conceivability and imaginability is misplaced. Though his challenge is primarily directed against the type-identity theory, Kripke thinks it also tells against token-identity theories, such as <a href="#anomalous_monism"><strong>ANOMALOUS MONISM</strong></a>. McGinn (1977) is a short piece arguing that this is a mistake. Hughes (2004) discusses both versions of the challenge in detail, and is strongly recommended. Indeed, if you’re going to read just one other thing on Kripke’s challenge, read this. See also Shoemaker (1994) for discussion of how it might be thought to tell against <a href="#functionalism"><strong>FUNCTIONALISM</strong></a>—although this is best left until after you’ve done some work on that topic. Bealer (1994) defends a version of Kripke’s modal argument, arguing that it favourably compares with the multiple realizability argument, the certainty argument (also known as the argument from doubt), and <strong>THE KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENT</strong>, and that, suitably adapted, it goes through. Contemporary discussion often focuses on a similar modal argument defended by David Chalmers. If you are working on Kripke’s challenge for finals, it is a good idea to familiarise yourself with this. See the entry for <strong>ZOMBIES</strong>.</p>

From Chalmers:


Chalmers (chapter 27) gives a related modal argument against materialism, supplemented by an analysis using two-dimensional semantics. Jackson (chapter 21) discusses some closely related issues involving modality and materialism. Levine (chapter 35) addresses Kripke's argument, while Loar (chapter 30) addresses modal arguments in a manner broadly compatible with Hill's approach. In the literature, modal arguments involving zombies are put forward by Campbell (1970) and Kirk (1974) and are developed by Chalmers (1996). Chalmers (1999) responds to Hill's and Loar's analyses. Gendler and Hawthorne (2002) contains a number of recent papers discussing modal arguments. Maxwell's view is grounded in some ideas of Russell (1927), which are developed in more depth by Lockwood (1989), and criticized by Foster (1991).
