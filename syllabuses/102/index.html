<h1 id="knowledge--reality">Knowledge &amp; Reality</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge &amp; Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="general-information">GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Before writing your essay, you should try to read all of the Core Reading for the topic unless otherwise indicated. Your essay and tutorial is only a first step towards an understanding of a topic, however. For finals, you will need to be able to answer any question that is set on around five topics, and you should use the Further Reading suggestions, in conjunction with the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading list</a>, in vacations to work on the topics that most interest you.</p>

<p>Plan your essay out <strong>before</strong> you do any reading. That might seem back to front: you haven’t done any reading, so how can you plan out what you’ve got to say? But as soon as you know what the essay question is, you can form some idea of the questions you need to be thinking about, and these will structure both your essay, at least in a preliminary way, and your reading. You can, and most likely will, revise your essay plan as you do the reading.</p>

<p>In addition to an essay, you should also be compiling notes, stating the main positions or puzzles relating to the week’s topic, with bullet points summarising their pros and cons. You should revise and supplement these notes after the tutorial and as you read and attend lectures on the subject over the rest of your time in Oxford. They are much more important than your essay. Your essay is a snapshot of your understanding of the topic at a particular time, taken from the particular angle determined by the essay question. In your exams, your answers will be snapshots of a much deeper understanding taken from a different angle - they will be answers to different questions! Your notes should be improving with your understanding.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Lycan (2006) is a useful discussion of various attempts to argue that knowledge cannot be analysed. Among other things, it includes a discussion of Zagzebski (1994). Greenough and Pritchard (2009) is a collection of papers on Williamson’s epistemology. For helpful discussion of his arguments against analysis and his positive proposal that knowledge is the most general factive state, see the papers by Quassim Cassam and Elizabeth Fricker, as well as Williamson’s replies.  </p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
‘It’s too easy to come up with counterexamples to putative analyses of knowledge in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, so we should abandon the attempt to construct such analyses.’ Is this a compelling argument? And should we give up the project of analysing knowledge?</p>

<p>‘The theory that knowledge is justified true belief is a simple and powerful proposal. Just as we accept simple and powerful, but highly counterintuitive, theories in fundamental physics, so too we may accept the knowledge proposal despite its counterintuitive consequences.’ Discuss.  </p>

For critical discussion of contextualism from the perspective of a prominent proponent of <em>subject-sensitive invariantism</em> (SSI), see Hawthorne (2004). For an up-to-date statement and defence of the position, see DeRose (2009). The debate between contextualism and SSI raises questions about the role of pragmatic elements in knowledge. For discussion, see Fantl and McGrath (2009). Conee and Cohen (2014) is a useful debate for and against contextualism. It includes, among other things, discussion of whether contextualism provides a satisfactory response to scepticism. </p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Are there any reasons to think that ‘know’ is context-sensitive, other than its potentially affording a response to scepticism?</p>

<p>‘When S knows that p, that is a non-linguistic fact about S’s mental state. That fact will obtain regardless of the linguistic context, and, hence, S will know that p in every such context. So epistemic contextualism is false.’ Discuss.</p>

<h2 id="possible-worlds">4. POSSIBLE WORLDS</h2>
<p><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is a possible world, and what reasons might there be for us to believe possible worlds other than the actual one exist?</p>

<p><strong>CORE READING</strong><br />
Christopher Menzel (2013) ‘Possible Worlds’ in E. Zalta, ed. <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>: <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/</a>.</p>

David Lewis (1973) <em>Counterfactuals</em> (Blackwell), Ch. 4, §1.    <br />
Robert Stalnaker (1976) ‘<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2214477">Possible Worlds</a>’ in <em>Noûs</em> 10(1), pp. 65–75. Reprinted in <strong>KK&amp;S</strong>.   <br />

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the first three chapters of David Lewis’s (1986) book are essential reading. The first lays out a case for his brand of modal realism, the second defends it from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. Sider (2003) discusses various reductive accounts of modality, including Lewis’s. Melia (1992) argues against modalism, the view (roughly) that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explicated in terms of objects’ essences. </p>

<p><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
In what sense, if any, are causes necessary and/or sufficient for their effects? Can causation be understood in terms of counterfactuals?  </p>

<p><strong>CORE READING</strong><br />
For an excellent, brief introduction to the topic, see Tim Crane (1995) ‘Causation’ in A. C. Grayling, ed. <em>Philosophy: A Guide Through the Subject</em> (OUP), esp. pp. 184-91.

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
For further discussion of the counterfactual approach and references, Menzies (2001/14) is the best starting point. For a defence of a version of Mackie’s INUS approach, see Strevens (2007). For Salmon’s approach, see his ‘Causality: Propagation and Production’, reprinted in <strong>S&amp;T</strong>, but Salmon (2002) is an easier way in. For an overview of manipulability approaches, see Woodward (2001/8). <strong>S&amp;T</strong> is an invaluable collection.

Do psychological factors have the upper hand in accommodating our intuitions about when persons persist over time? Are psychological factors dominant in determining our intuitions regarding what it takes for a person to persist over time?</p>

<p>Does the psychological view of personal identity face challenges that other views on personal identity easily avoid?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Dainton (2010) is excellent overview of the main issues. Zimmerman and Smart (2008) is a recent debate. Zimmerman defends presentism, a view most closely associated with Prior, while Smart, like Horwich, defends the B-theory. Fine (2006) is difficult but rewards the effort, arguing for the reality of tense. Lewis (1976) is a defence of the possibility of backwards time travel. </p>

In what sense, if any, does time flow in a particular direction?

Is time travel possible? What does this tell us about the nature of time?

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Zimmerman (1998) defends a presentist solution to the problem of temporary intrinsics. Hawthorne (2008) is a very useful discussion, distinguishing the question of whether objects <em>have</em> temporal parts with different properties from the question of whether objects change over time <em>because</em> they have temporal parts with different properties, opening up the prospect of a four-dimensionalist endurantism. Thomson (1983) and Olson (2006) discuss another puzzle related to persistence over time: the issue of how objects can gain or lose parts over time. </p>

How, if at all, do ordinary physical objects persist?</p>

<p>Is the phenomenon of change of properties over time any more puzzling than the variation of temperature along the length of an iron bar?</p>

<!--
Do objects have temporal parts?


What is the best account of how objects can gain or lose parts over time?

Are there any good reasons to prefer the view that objects persist by perduring rather than by enduring?
