<h1 id="knowledge--reality">Knowledge &amp; Reality</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge &amp; Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have (generally) divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, with four weeks on topics in epistemology and three weeks on topics in metaphysics. I’ve left the last week open, so as to allow you to choose a topic yourself. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. (These are divided into topics in Epistemology, Metaphysics, and For Self-Study, the latter being those you will most likely have looked at in first year work for General Philosophy, and so might feel comfortable exploring on your own.)</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Knowledge &amp; Reality to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. I’m grateful to various friends and colleagues for advice and discussion of it, especially Alex Kaiserman, Brent Madison, and Nick Tasker. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of the list at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<p>There are no set textbooks but it will be useful to do some reading over the vacation beforehand. The following are all recommended. Most are fairly introductory. The exception is Williamson (2000), which is quite advanced. However, we’ll be looking at it in depth in week four and possibly beyond, so it’s worth getting acquainted with it early on. Focus in particular on the Introduction and first couple of chapters.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In exploring this topic in more depth, start with the relevant debates in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>, which could easily have served as <strong>CORE READING</strong>. James Pryor’s contribution is particularly important: his <em>dogmatism</em> is, alongside Michael Huemer’s <em>phenomenal conservatism</em>, one of the main foundationalist developments of recent years. You can look at the issues surrounding it in more detail if you do the <strong>SCEPTICISM</strong> topic. For an important problem facing these views, as well as alternative externalist forms of foundationalism, the problem of easy knowledge, see Cohen (2002). Greco and Sosa, eds. (1999) contains a couple of useful discussions: Williams’s ‘Skepticism’, defending a non-standard position that he calls <em>contextualism</em>—be warned: this is a different view to the one examined in the <a href="#contextualism"><strong>CONTEXTUALISM</strong></a> topic—and Bonjour’s ‘The Dialectic of Foundationalism and Coherentism’, setting out the sorts of considerations that led him to abandon the coherentism of his (1985) for a form of foundationalism. For more on infinitism, see the papers in Turri and Klein, eds. (2014). Other good introductions and overviews include Hasan and Fumerton (2000/16) and Olsson (2003/17), and Fumerton (2018).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>In working further on this topic, start by getting a good sense of what epistemic contextualism is. The best way to do this is to think about alternative views, including classical invariantism and subject-sensitive invariantism (SSI). Classical invariantism is defended in Brown (2006). SSI is defended by Hawthorne in the Core Reading. Think also about different ways in which contextualism can be developed. Lewis (1996) is important here. DeRose fleshes out his case for contextualism and replies to objections in his (2009). McKenna (2015) is a useful survey of recent work. The debate between contextualists and SSIs raises questions about the role of pragmatic factors, such as practical interests, in knowledge. Fantl and McGrath (2009) is a great discussion of this, and one of the best books in epistemology of the last wee while. Kim (2017) a survey of the recent debate. <b>ST&amp;S</b> is also useful here, containing accessible debates between Fantl and McGrath and Baron Reed over whether pragmatic factors affect knowledge, as well as Conee and Cohen over contextualism itself. The latter includes, among other things, discussion of whether contextualism provides a satisfactory response to the sceptic. See also DeRose (2017), developing his contextualist treatment of sceptical and lottery puzzles.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Our topic for this week and next is Tim Williamson’s knowledge-first epistemology, set out in his <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i>. This is the most influential book of the past 40 or so years in epistemology, and arguably in analytic philosophy more generally, so it is well worth studying in depth. (I’ve assumed you’re familiar from first year work in General Philosophy with the Gettier problem and various responses to it. If you’re not familiar with these, let me know before the start of term so that I can suggest a slightly different set of topics in epistemology.) In thinking about the main themes, you’d do well to look at some of the critical responses in Greenough and Pritchard, eds. (2009), together with Williamson’s replies. Particularly recommended are the pieces by Quassim Cassam and Elizabeth Fricker. See also the debate between Williamson and Trent Dougherty and Patrick Rysiew in <b>ST&amp;S</b>, Nagel (2013), Hyman (2014), and the papers in the Carter, Gordon, and Jarvis, eds. (2017)—especially the editors’ Introduction, and the papers by Smith and by Ichikawa and Jenkins. But perhaps the main thing to look at is Ch. 3 of <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i>, which, as Williamson says, deepens the critique of internalism. It’s usefully read in combination with Yablo (2003). McGlynn (2014) is a nice monograph on the topic, and will be usefully read in connection with whatever you choose to focus on next week too.</p>

<p>If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the rest of Melia’s (2003) book is very helpful, and the rest of Lewis’s (1986) is essential. The second defends Lewis’s brand of modal realism from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. The fourth and final chapter defends counterpart theory, his alternative to the view that there are transworld identities. Menzel (2013/16) provides an accessible overview of the issues surrounding Lewis-style realism, abstractionism or ersatzism, and combinatorialism—this last a view that is particularly associated with David Armstrong; see his (2004). <b>SH&amp;Z</b> contains an accessible debate between Phillip Bricker and Joseph Melia, with Bricker defending concretism and Melia defending ersatzism. You should also look at important alternative approaches to modality. Rosen (1990) defends a fictionalist approach, while Melia (1992) is a critical discussion of modalism, the view (roughly) that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explicated in terms of objects’ essences. Kripke (1980) is the source of his influential Humphrey objection to Lewis-style realism, and argues that the so-called problem of trans-world identity, pressed by Chisholm (1967) among others, is a pseudo-problem. For more on this issue, see Mackie and Jago’s (2006/17) survey article for the <i>Stanford Encyclopedia</i>.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-4">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>For an introduction to the other main issues for this topic, you won’t do better than chapters 3 to 8 of Dainton (2010). Inspired by McTaggart, the issues are usually posed in terms of a distinction between A-theory and B-theory—though see Parsons (2002) for discussion of what the core commitments here really are. There is an accessible debate in <b>SH&amp;Z</b> between Dean Zimmerman and Jack Smart, with Zimmerman defending the main A-theory, <em>presentism</em>, and Smart defending the B-theory. Beyond that, think about other A-theories, such as the so-called <em>growing block</em> and <em>moving spotlight</em> views. The papers by Correia and Rosenkranz and Braddon-Mitchell in Bennett and Zimmerman, eds. (2014) discuss the former; the latter was long regarded the poor relation among A-theories, but see Cameron (2015) for a recent and influential attempt to revive it. Prosser (2017) is a recent book-length defence of the B-theory, focused on explaining various aspects of our experience of time that seem to tell against the view. Another thing to think about is time travel. Is it possible? Does it pose a problem for particular views about time? Lewis (1976) argues that it’s possible. See also Vihvelin (1996) for discussion, and Wasserman (2017) for a recent book on the topic. Lastly, try Fine (2006), a fantastic, albeit rather tough-going paper discussing McTaggart, and offering an interesting interpretation of Dummett’s position.</p>

<p><b>H&amp;K</b> is a very useful collection, containing various classic pieces, and is a great place to start if you’re working on the topic in more depth, as are three, more or less introductory surveys: Balashov (2012), Effingham (2012), and Gallois (2005/16). For more on the argument from coincidence or co-location, see McGrath (2007). And see Koslicki (2003) for more on Sider’s argument from vagueness. The debate between Sider and Hawthorne in <b>SH&amp;Z</b> is a nice, accessible debate over whether objects have temporal parts. Hofweber (2009) argues that there’s no genuine problem of change, a view to which I’m fairly sympathetic. So too is Iris Einheuser (2012), who agrees that there’s not, but argues that there’s nevertheless a <em>meta</em>-problem of change. Magidor (2016) is another nice discussion, running through a host of different arguments that are offered in the literature, arguing that they are strictly orthogonal to the debate between endurantists and perdurantists.</p>

<p>In getting a better grasp of this topic, I think it’s particularly helpful to understand how the notion of the <em>a priori</em> has figured in the history of philosophy. At the very least, you’ll want to look at Quine (1953). Though it doesn’t actually contain the expression “<em>a priori</em>”, it’s a renowned attack on what Bonjour calls moderate empiricism, and attempts to put a form of radical empiricism in its place. You’ll find good discussion of the issues in the first few chapters of Bonjour (1998), and a recent attempt to resuscitate moderate empiricism in the face of Quine’s attack in Boghossian (2003). In exploring contemporary work by other philosophers on the <em>a priori</em>, you should follow up the relevant references in Jenkins (2008). You’ll want to think, in the first place, about accounts of the <em>a priori</em> from the likes of Field and Peacocke, as well as Jenkins herself. Boghossian and Peacocke (2000) contains many key contributions to recent debate, including a paper by Kitcher reflecting on critical reaction to his (1980) paper. You’ll also want to think about Kripke, and alleged instances of contingent <em>a priori</em> truths. To that end, try Hawthorne (2002) and Chalmers (2008). (This is an issue that you’ll most likely encounter again if you do Philosophy of Mind, and certainly if you do Philosophical Logic.) Lastly, have a think a bit about whether the distinction between the <em>a priori</em> and the <em>a posteriori</em> is significant. Williamson (2013) is a recent paper arguing that it isn’t; Casullo (2015) is a response.</p>

<p>The literature for this topic is huge. Unless you’re studying him for Early Modern Philosophy, you needn’t worry too much about the ins and outs of the scholarly debate over Hume’s views on causation, but you will want to look at discussion of the other Core Readings, especially the Mackie and the Lewis. For discussion of Mackie, see the first paper by Jaegwon Kim in <b>S&amp;T</b> and Scriven (2007). For discussion of Lewis, see the second paper by Kim in <b>S&amp;T</b>, as well as the papers by Horwich and Bennett. In order to overcome difficulties with his (1973) view, Lewis developed a different counterfactual theory, which is presented in his paper ‘Causation as Influence’ in Collins, Hall, and Paul, eds. (2004). Menzies (2001/14) provides a great overview of the issues surrounding these and other counterfactual approaches. You should also have a look at other approaches to causation. Perhaps the main one is the interventionist approach, a non-reductionist counterfactual approach that draws on the work of the computer scientist Judea Pearl. Woodward (2001/16) is a good introduction. Pearl and Mackenzie (2018) is an accessible account of Pearl’s work. If you’re interested in probablistic approaches, see in the first instance Hitchcock (1997/2018). Another approach worth looking at is the physical process acccount defended by the likes of Wesley Salmon. See his paper in <b>S&amp;T</b>, though perhaps the best introduction is his (2002). His view has fallen out of favour somewhat recently, however. Part of its appeal was the promise of an account of preemption cases, but on further examination, it’s not so clear. There’s some nice discussion of this and other issues in Hall (2009). The other pieces in <b>S&amp;T</b> are recommended; indeed, the editors’ introduction and the papers by Davidson and Tooley are all essential reading. See also the debate between Carroll and Schaffer in <b>SH&amp;Z</b> over whether or not there’s anything more to causal necessity than mere regularity. Lastly, try Psillos (2003) for a good, more or less book-length overview of the issues. It’s a little too advanced to count as genuinely introductory, but provides detailed discussion of the Core Reading and other important approaches, including interventionism.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-10">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In working further on this topic, you could do worse than work through the chapters of Part 2 of Berto and Plebani (2015), looking more closely at individual papers defending the views they discuss. Try the paper by Kris McDaniels in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009) for an example of the Ontological Pluralism discussed in Ch. 4, and Linnebo (2012) for an example of Neo-Fregeanism. For the Neo-Carnapianism discussed in Ch. 5, try Hirsch (2002), Thomas Hofweber’s paper in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), and Thomasson (2008). Fictionalism, discussed in Ch. 8 of Berto and Plebani (2015), is defended by Stephen Yablo in the piece above. For Meinongianism, discussed in Ch. 7, start with Reicher (2006/19). Fine (2012) is an example of the Grounding Approach discussed in Ch. 8. You’ll find other various useful papers in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), along with a handy editors’ introduction. Two other recommendations: Lewis and Lewis (1970), a dialogue between two philosophers discussing whether there are holes, is a must-read, while Effingham (2013) is a fantastic introductory book, aimed at undergraduates and discussing issues of meta-ontology in relation to debates in specific areas of metaphysics. It can be profitably read in working further not just on meta-ontology, but also on topics such as <a href="#possible_worlds"><strong>POSSIBLE WORLDS</strong></a>, <a href="#time"><strong>TIME</strong></a>, and <a href="#persistence"><strong>PERSISTENCE</strong></a>.</p>

<h4 id="past-paper-questions-24">PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</h4>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in more depth, Locke’s discussion in his <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (Bk II, Ch. 27) is essential reading, as are the famous replies from Thomas Reid and Joseph Butler. These are usefully collected, along with various other pieces, in Perry, ed. (2008). You’ll also want to think a bit about Williams. For some discussion, see the piece by Nozick in <strong>M&amp;B</strong>, Noonan (1982), and John Perry’s piece ‘Williams on The Self and the Future’ in Perry, ed. (2008). Otherwise, you should focus on Parfit and animalism. <strong>M&amp;B</strong> contains a number of pieces discussing Parfit: those by Lewis, Korsgaard, Unger, Sosa, Martin, Schechtman, and Johnston, as well as Parfit’s own ‘The Unimportance of Identity’. Lewis’s response is particularly important, and will seem less <em>ad hoc</em> if you’ve encountered his views on persistence more generally. For discussion of animalism, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Snowdon (1990) is an important statement and defence of the position. For other discussions, see Olson (2004), Shoemaker (2008), Madden (2011), and the collection, Blatti and Snowdon, eds. (2016)—the last containing a piece by Parfit arguing against animalism. For a recent book on personal identity, aimed at undergraduates, try Kind (2015).</p>
