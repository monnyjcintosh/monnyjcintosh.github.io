<h1 id="knowledge-and-reality">Knowledge and Reality</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge and Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, let me know, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover four topics in <strong>EPISTEMOLOGY</strong> (<a href="#knowledge">The Analysis of Knowledge</a>†, <a href="#closure">Epistemic Closure</a>†, <a href="#contextualism">Contextualism</a>, <a href="#statistical_evidence">Statistical Evidence</a>) and four in <strong>METAPHYSICS</strong> (<a href="#causation">Causation</a>, <a href="#modality">Modality</a>, <a href="#time">Time</a>, and <a href="#persistence">Persistence</a>). But this is not set in stone, and I have provided some suggestions for alternative topics. If you want to cover one of these instead, let me know, and I’ll see what we can do. Note that topics you may have covered in first year, and so might want to leave for self-study in vacations, are marked with a dagger (†).</p>

<p>The reading for each topic is divided into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>. In writing your tutorial essay, focus on the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, using  as guides the more introductory texts marked with a star (*) and any Faculty lectures on the topic—the lectures are often available online via <a href="http://www.canvas.ox.ac.uk/">Canvas</a>, and are a good indication of what might come up in the exams. You can then look at the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, as well as anything else on the <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/oxford/lists/76A93325-90FB-7907-BE8D-4E11EEA44C4E.html">Faculty Reading List</a>, when exploring topics in more depth during later vacations.</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Knowledge &amp; Reality to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. I’m grateful to various friends and colleagues for advice and discussion, especially Alex Kaiserman, Brent Madison, and Nick Tasker. If you’d like to use the list for teaching, please feel free. Feedback and corrections are gratefully received!</p>

<p>If you are not yet sure whether Knowledge &amp; Reality is the paper for you, have a look at the following overviews of metaphysics and epistemology for the <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i>, as well as the various topics below, so as to better appreciate the sorts of issues you would be thinking and writing about.</p>

<h4 id="anthologies-and-collections">ANTHOLOGIES and COLLECTIONS</h4>

<p>While most of the readings can be obtained online, it’s often useful to have good anthologies and collections of papers in epistemology and metaphysics, so as to be able to read around a bit more widely. The following are all recommended, containing many of the key readings and more besides, and are referenced below:</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The background to this topic is, of course, Gettier (1963), arguing that justified true belief that P is not sufficient for knowledge that P. If you’re working on this topic in more depth, you’ll want to familiarise yourself with some of the many responses to Gettier’s paper. Pappas and Swain, eds. (1978) is useful here, collecting some of the most important contributions published in the first fifteen years afterwards. Zagzebski, in the Core Reading, attempts to draw a general lesson from the debate, as does Blome-Tillman (2007), to whom Kearns (2007) replies. At first sight, Zagzebski’s paper suggests a dilemma: in analysing knowledge as true belief plus some further condition X, the third condition will either be non-factive, and liable to counter-example, or factive, but extremely demanding, ruling out much of what we intuitively deem to be knowledge. As Lycan explains, however, this isn’t quite right. Various of the candidates that have been offered for X have been factive and yet not obviously overly demanding. Consider, for example, a crude causal analysis, on which S knows that P IFF S has a true belief that is causally connected to the fact that P. Much of the contemporary debate takes its cue from this observation, and investigates the prospects for, <em>inter alia</em>, anti-luck, sensitivity, and safety approaches to the analysis of knowledge. For anti-luck approaches, see the debate between Pritchard and Hetherington, ‘Can Knowledge Be Lucky?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>; you can look at the latter two approaches in more depth in connection with <a href="#closure"><strong>EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</strong></a>. See also the virtue-theoretic approach of Sosa (2007), among others. One of the main questions to consider is whether these approaches, while avoiding counter-examples constructed in accordance with Zagzebski’s recipe, nevertheless run into problems with the sort of Barn County cases described by Goldman (1976). See, for example, Gendler and Hawthorne (2005). A related question, arising out of debates surrounding safety-based approaches, is whether a successful analysis need be non-circular to be illuminating. You’ll find discussion of many of the issues in Borges, de Almeida, and Klein, eds. (2017), including a contribution from Zagzebski reflecting on her earlier (1994) paper. Williamson’s view that knowledge is a mental state, and should be taken as an explanatory primitive in epistemology, has been very influential. In thinking about it more, you’ll find plenty to chew on in Greenough and Pritchard, eds. (2009). See also the debate between Williamson and Dougherty and Rysiew, ‘Should Knowledge Come First?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>. You can explore a key aspect of Williamson’s position—his view that there are no <em>luminous</em> conditions, i.e. conditions such that, whenever they obtain, one is in a position to know that they obtain—in doing <a href="#internalism&amp;externalism"><strong>INTERNALISM and EXTERNALISM</strong></a>. Craig (1990) offers an analysis of knowledge, motivating it not by appeal to intuitions but by reflection on the role the concept of knowledge plays for us—a <em>function-first</em> approach. For discussion, try Williams (2002). For more on the methodological significance of intuitions, see Weatherson (2003), defending the JTB analysis, Gettier cases notwithstanding.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Dretske (1970) offers a range of arguments against closure. Perhaps the most interesting is based on a <em>relevant alternatives</em> account of apparent counter-examples, such as that of the zebra that, intuitively, you know to be a zebra but don’t know is not a cleverly disguised mule. Knowing that P, Dretske suggests, requires ruling out all relevant alternatives to P, where an alternative Q to P is <em>relevant</em> IFF Q is true in at least some of the close by worlds in which P is false. While you can rule out all relevant alternatives to such propositions as that it is a zebra before you, you cannot rule out all relevant alternatives to the proposition that it is not a cleverly painted mule. In particular, you cannot rule out the proposition that it <em>is</em> a cleverly painted mule. Of various responses to Dretske’s article, Stine (1976) is a highlight, working within the same relevant alternatives framework, but defending closure by offering an alternative account of what it is for an alternative to be relevant—one that, in retrospect, amounts to a prototypical form of <a href="#contextualism"><strong>CONTEXTUALISM</strong></a>. Vogel (1990) is another good discussion. Nozick’s (1983) truth-tracking or sensitivity account of knowledge, which may be familiar to you from first year work for General Philosophy, is a variation on Dretske’s relevant alternatives theme, and has been widely discussed. Kripke’s influential (2011) paper was circulated in manuscript form for many years, and argues that Nozick’s account leads to wildly implausible violations of closure. In thinking more about the issues here, look at rival approaches, especially the safety approach defended by Sosa (1999), among others, and the modified version of Nozick’s own sensitivity approach defended by Roush (2005). See also Williams (1996), Ch. 7 of Williamson’s (2000) <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i>—listed as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for <a href="#knowledge"><strong>THE ANALYSIS of KNOWLEDGE</strong></a>—and the debate between Dretske and Hawthorne, ‘Is Knowledge Closed Under Known Entailment?’ in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>. There are various issues concerning whether Nozick’s position affords a viable response to <a href="#scepticism"><strong>SCEPTICISM</strong></a>. One question, explored by Williamson, is whether it has unacceptable sceptical implications itself. Another: isn’t it question-begging, relying on the assumption that we’re not in the bad case? For a short, classic presentation of the worry, one which might be raised against externalist responses to the sceptic quite generally, see Craig (1989). Sharon and Spectre offer a novel approach. Like Dretske and Nozick, they base their argument against closure on an explanation of apparent counter-examples. Unlike Dretske’s and Nozick’s, however, their explanation does not involve externalism, but is based rather what they call the <em>openness of evidence</em>. For discussion, see Comesaña (2017), as well as Sharon and Spectre’s (2017b) reply.</p>

<p>Put roughly, epistemic contextualism is the view that the truth-conditions of sentences of the form, <u>S knows that P</u>, depend on epistemologically significant features of the context of utterance. (The qualification that the relevant features are epistemologically significant matters: pretty much everyone accepts that the truth-conditions of the sentences in question depend on some features of the context of utterance, if only because of their tense.) It stands in opposition to <em>invariantism</em>, the view that the truth-conditions of sentences of the form, <u>S knows that P</u>, don’t depend on epistemologically significant features of the context of utterance. The idea goes back at least as far as the 70s—see especially Gail Stine’s paper, listed in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#closure"><strong>EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</strong></a>. But the key papers came out a little later. See especially Cohen (1988), DeRose (1996), and Lewis (1996), combining the infallibilist idea that knowing that P is a matter of having evidence that rules out all possibilities in which ¬P with the idea that the domain of quantification (“<em>all</em> possibilities”) is subject to contextual restriction. Various arguments for contextualism have been advanced. Perhaps the most promising—the so-called <em>context shifting arguments</em>—focus on intuitions about how the truth values of certain sentences vary across certain sorts of contexts. In thinking about the topic in more depth, think carefully about what exactly these various arguments show. <em>Classical</em> invariantists try to explain away the relevant intuitions. Brown in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, for instance, argues that they can be explained in terms of warranted assertability. See also the debate between Conee and Cohen, ‘Is Knowledge Contextual?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>. <em>Subject sensitive</em> invariantists (also known as <em>interest relative</em> or <em>sensitive moderate</em> invariantists) offer an alternative response, arguing that the variation in truth value, while often genuine, reflects variation in epistemologically significant features, not of the context of <em>utterance</em>, i.e. of the <em>ascriber</em> or speaker, but of the context of the <em>subject</em>. This involves making a quite radical move, on which the epistemic status of a subject depends not just on truth-related factors such as her evidence, but also on pragmatic factors such as her practical interests. This <em>pragmatic encroachment</em> has become something of a hot topic lately. In addition to Hawthorne in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, it’s defended by Stanley (2005) and Fantl and McGrath (2009). See also the debate between Fantl and McGrath and Reed, ‘Do Practical Matters Affect Whether You Know?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong> and, for the state of the art, various of the papers on the proposal in Kim and McGrath, eds. (2019). DeRose in his (2009) book, responds to both strategies in defence of contextualism. Contextualism is primarily a thesis in the philosophy of language, but one that its proponents typically claim has important consequences for epistemology, and especially <a href="#scepticism"><strong>SCEPTICISM</strong></a>. For some pushback against this, see Feldman (1999) and Sosa (2000). The debate between Conee and Cohen, ‘Is Knowledge Contextual?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>, is also relevant here, as is Stroud (1984), a classic discussion of whether scepticism rests on setting overly demanding standards for knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-4">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>This week’s topic is the debate between internalists and externalists about epistemic justification. Put roughly, internalists about justification hold that whether or not a subject’s belief is justified depends only on internal factors, while externalists deny this, and insist that whether or not a subject’s belief is justified may depend on external factors—whether or not it was produced by a reliable process, for example. The debate goes back to the late 70s. Bonjour (1980) is a key contribution, and may be familiar to you from first year work in General Philosophy. He presents various examples of clairvoyants, like the famous Norman, which suggest that purely external factors are insufficient for justification; the so-called <em>new evil demon problem</em>, discussed in Cohen (1984), suggests that they aren’t necessary either. Other arguments for internalism are more theoretical, often making use of the idea that justification is a deontological concept, to be understood in terms of the concepts of permission, duty, and obligation. See, for instance, the guidance argument presented and criticised in Goldman (1999), as well as the argument from akrasia presented in Smithies (2012) and criticised in Salow (2019). See also Bergmann (2006) and Gibbons (2006), two critiques of internalism. Recent debate has often focused on the issues raised by the anti-luminosity argument presented in Ch. 4 (and again in Ch. 8) of Williamson (2000). Berker (2008), in the Core Reading, criticises the argument, arguing that it trades on controversial views about vagueness; Srinivasan (2013) replies. Schoenfield (2015) argues that internalism can be defended without luminosity; Wedgwood (2017) takes a similar line. A key issue here is how internalism is best understood: as <em>access internalism</em>, the view that whether or not an agent’s belief is justified depends only on facts that are reflectively accessible to that agent? Or as <em>mentalism</em>, the view that whether or not an agent’s belief is justified depends only on facts about the agent’s mental states? Access internalism is probably the orthodox position, and the one that is most obviously targeted by the anti-luminosity argument. For an influential defence of mentalism, see Feldman and Conee (2001). See also the debate between Greco and Feldman, ‘Is Justification Internal?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>. The anti-luminosity argument is arguably the centrepiece of Williamson (2000), but you might also want to take a look at Ch. 9, where, taking his <em>knowledge-first</em> approach, he explains justification in terms of knowledge, arguing both that one is justified in believing something IFF it is supported by one’s evidence and that E=K, i.e. one’s evidence just is one’s knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-5">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The topic this week is the structure of epistemic justification, and Agrippa’s trilemma, or the regress problem: for S’s belief that P to be justified, it seems S has to have a reason for that belief, but if her reason for that belief is another belief, it must also be justified; an infinite regress of reasons thus seems to loom. Going back at least as far as Aristotle, it has often been argued that the solution to the problem is <em>foundationalism</em>, the view that the regress terminates with a class of <em>non-inferentially</em> justified beliefs, or <em>basic</em> beliefs: beliefs that do not depend for their justification on further beliefs. Bonjour, in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, presents an influential argument against foundationalism, revolving around two ideas: first, the strongly internalist idea that one’s belief is justified only if one is in possession of a reason for thinking that the belief is likely to be true; second, that possessing a reason for thinking a belief is likely to be true is a matter of having justified beliefs that entail that it is likely to be true. In response, some reject the strong internalism. See, for example, the essays in Part I of Alston (1989), especially ‘What’s Wrong with Immediate Knowledge?’, and, for the broader issues at stake in debates over internalism, <a href="#internalism&amp;externalism"><strong>INTERNALISM &amp; EXTERNALISM</strong></a>. Others offer responses that are compatible with the internalism, rejecting instead the idea that possessing a reason for thinking a belief is likely to be true is matter of having further justified beliefs. They thus face the challenge posed by the <em>Sellarsian dilemma</em> developed in section IV of Bonjour’s paper. Huemer, in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, offers a response to this. His <em>phenomenal conservatism</em> is one of the main developments in recent work. See also Pryor’s similar <em>dogmatist</em> approach, which he defends in a debate with Comesaña in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>, ‘Is There Immediate Justification?’. For critical discussion of their approaches, see the various papers in Tucker, ed. (2013). See also the various readings discussing Pryor’s dogmatism suggested in connection with <a href="#scepticism"><strong>SCEPTICISM</strong></a>. 
Huemer and Pryor are <em>moderate</em> foundationalists, holding, in contrast to the more demanding classical or <em>strong</em> foundationalism associated with the likes of Descartes, that basic beliefs need not be infallible, indubitable, or incorrigible. For an alternative response to the Sellarsian dilemma, offered in defence of a form of strong foundationalism, try Fumerton (1995). For an interesting externalist response, see Lyons (2008). 
In arguing against foundationalism, Bonjour joined a tradition that stretches back to the Pyrrhonians, a group of sceptics (including Agrippa) who lived between the 4th and 1st centuries BCE. Bonjour’s argument was offered as part of an attempt to defend not scepticism, but <em>coherentism</em>, the view that the justification of a belief depends on how it coheres within one’s entire system of beliefs. See Part II of his (1985). Bonjour himself eventually abandoned coherentism for strong foundationalism, however, as he explains in his contribution to Bonjour and Sosa (2003)—he replies to his earlier argument against foundationalism in Ch. 4—and coherentism seems to have fallen somewhat out of favour in recent times. See Olsson’s (2003/21) survey for an overview of work on the topic, as well as the debate, ‘Can Belief Be Justified Through Coherence Alone?’, between Elgin and van Cleve in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>, and section 2 of Huemer’s accessible (2010) article. Alongside coherentism’s demise, however, there has been a lot of interest in <em>infinitism</em>, the view, defended by Klein in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, that a belief may be justified by an infinite (non-repeating) chain of reasons. For discussion, see Turri and Klein, eds. (2015), as well as the debate between Klein and Ginet, ‘Is Infinitism the Solution to the Regress Problem?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>. Section 3 of Huemer (2010) discusses Klein’s and another problem for foundationalism, the <em>bootstrapping</em> or <em>easy knowledge problem</em>, raised by Cohen (2002).</p>

<p>We’ve looked at some responses to external world scepticism in previous weeks already, especially in connection with <a href="#closure"><strong>EPISTEMIC CLOSURE</strong></a> and <a href="#contextualism"><strong>CONTEXTUALISM</strong></a>. You may also be familiar with various other responses from first year work for General Philosophy, in particular the semantic externalist response associated with Hilary Putnam and the epistemic externalist response associated with reliabilists, like Alvin Goldman. You’ll find classic pieces on all these in DeRose and Warfield, eds. (1999), listed in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, which is an invaluable resource, and good pieces on closure-denying, contextualist, and epistemic externalist responses in another very useful collection, Greco, ed. (2008). For more on semantic externalism, see also the excellent Button (2013). You’ll also want to think about various internalist responses, not represented in the DeRose and Warfield collection. For starters, there’s the <em>epistemological disjunctivism</em> of McDowell (1982), listed in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>. For criticism, see Wright (2002). <!--EXPLAIN. Link with Williamson.--> <!--Discussion in Part III of Dodd and Zardini.--> Millar’s piece in Greco, ed. (2008), provides an overview, and there are connections with issues you can explore in doing <a href="#perception"><strong>PERCEPTION</strong></a>. There are also interesting similarities between the epistemological disjunctivist approach to scepticism and Williamson’s—see his (2009) as well as Ch. 8 of his (2000) book, listed as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for both <a href="#knowledge"><strong>THE ANALYSIS of KNOWLEDGE</strong></a> and <a href="#internalism&amp;externalism"><strong>INTERNALISM and EXTERNALISM</strong></a>. <!--The no-Moorean *dogmatism* of Pryor (2000) in the **CORE READING**, and criticised in White (2006) and Siegel (2012), is more orthodox, holding that there's an evidential symmetry between good and bad cases. Similar to Huemer's PC...--> There’s also the neo-Moorean <em>dogmatism</em> of Pryor (2000) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, and criticised in White (2006) and Siegel (2012). Pryor’s dogmatism is very similar to Huemer’s phenomenal conservatism, as mentioned in the guide to the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#agrippa"><strong>AGRIPPA’S TRILEMMA</strong></a>, and the readings suggested there on the latter will also be relevant to the former. Lastly, contrasting with both epistemological disjunctivist and dogmatist responses, there is the <em>apriorist</em> response of, e.g., Wright (2004). Vogel’s contribution to Greco, ed. (2008) is also useful here, discussing dogmatism, apriorism, and the debate between them. See also Vogel’s contribution to his debate with Fumerton, ‘Can Skepticism Be Refuted?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>. In thinking about apriorism, think also about <a href="#a_priori"><strong>THE A PRIORI</strong></a>, and how, if at all, apriorists might account for how we can acquire the <em>a priori</em> knowledge and justification they posit. One issue bearing on many of the debates, is that of what, if anything, is wrong with Moore’s proof of the external world. See Wright (2002), Pryor (2004), and Coliva (2013), as well as Ch. 3 of Stroud (1984), listed in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#contextualism"><strong>CONTEXTUALISM</strong></a>.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-7">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p><em>A priori</em> knowledge or justification is, to a first approximation, knowledge or justification that is had independently of experience. Independent how, exactly? In particular, is it supposed to be <em>indefeasible</em>? It was standardly thought that it was, but the 1980s saw the beginning of some pushback against this. See Kitcher (1980), defending indefeasibility, and Casullo (1988), criticising it. The issue bears on what is perhaps the central question, whether the possibility of <em>a priori</em> knowledge or justification can be explained in terms of analyticity, or mastery of concepts. The suggestion that it can dominated discussion of the <em>a priori</em> going back to Hume—see the chapter from A. J. Ayer’s (1936) book, <em>Language, Truth, and Logic</em>, reprinted in Moser, ed. (1987) for a classic statement of the view—but fell out of favour in the wake of the famous attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction in W. V. O. Quine’s (1956) ‘Two Dogmas of Empiricism’, also reprinted in Moser, ed. (1987). A central element of the attack was that no statement is immune to revision. But if <em>a priori</em> knowledge and justification is defeasible, this doesn’t seem to be a pressing concern. Other worries about the analyticity, or mastery of concepts approach remain. For one thing, it seems subject to counterexamples. ‘Nothing is both red and green all over’ is a famous case in point. It is supposed to be knowable <em>a priori</em>, but it is notoriously hard to see how it can be analytic. But the deepest challenge, pressed by Bonjour (1998) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, is to explain how the proposal is supposed to work: how exactly does mastery of concepts yield <em>a priori</em> knowledge or justification? Boghossian (2003) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> defends one, seemingly promising answer, appealing to <em>inferentialism</em>, the view that mastery of at least certain concepts (most plausibly logical concepts) is constituted by being disposed to reason with them in certain ways: to grasp the concepts <em>or</em> and <em>not</em>, for example, is just to be disposed to reason in accordance with their introduction and elimination rules. These dispositions, the thought goes, determine certain judgements (<em>it’s raining or it’s not raining</em>, for example) to be true and certain inferences (from <em>it’s raining</em> to <em>it’s raining or 2+2=5</em>, for example) to be valid. In making these judgements and inferences, therefore, the agent who grasps the relevant concepts makes judgements and inferences whose truth or validity is guaranteed, and so justified. Various worries can be raised about the strategy, however. First, there’s the <em>defective concepts</em> worry, that the dispositions to reason associated with certain concepts—Arthur Prior’s <em>tonk</em> is a famous case—determine judgements and inferences that are not true or valid. Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, it has been questioned whether mastery of concepts is ever constituted by dispositions to reason in certain ways. Philosophers of logic disagree, for example, about the introduction and elimination rules of <em>not</em>, but it seems mistaken to think that either party need fail to grasp the concept. Both worries are raised by Field (2005) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and in considerable detail by Williamson (2007)—see §2 for the first worry, and §3 for the second. There has been an ongoing and fruitful debate between Williamson and Boghossian about inferentialism and the <em>a priori</em> more generally, which is collected together and continued in their (2020) book. For another way of trying to explain <em>a prioricity</em> in terms of mastery of concepts, see Jenkins (2012). Bonjour offers an alternative, <em>rationalist</em> account in Ch. 4 to 6 of his (1998) book, explaining the <em>a priori</em> in terms not of mastery of concepts, but of rational intuition or insight into the necessary structure of the world. In thinking about all of these approaches, you’ll want to think about Kripke’s examples of apparently contingent <em>a priori</em> truths. See the extracts from his (1980) <em>Naming and Necessity</em> in Moser, ed. (1987), as well as the discussion in the papers there by Casullo, Swinburne, and Kitcher. See also Chalmers (2004), who attempts to defuse the problem by appeal to a distinction between deeply and superficially contingent <em>a priori</em> truths: to pose a genuine problem, the idea runs, Kripke’s examples would need to be examples of the former, but they are in fact examples of the latter. (Chalmers employs the framework of two-dimensional modal logic, which will be familiar to those of you doing Philosophical Logic.) See also Hawthorne (2002), however, tentatively offering what seem to be examples of deeply contingent <em>a priori</em> truths. Think also about Field’s <em>nonfactualism</em> and Quine’s radical empiricism, critically discussed in Ch. 3 of Bonjour (1998). See also the debate, ‘Is There A Priori Knowledge?’, between Bonjour and Devitt, a radical empiricist, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>. Lastly, think about whether the distinction between <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> is all that clear, or theoretically significant anyway. See Hawthorne (2007) and Williamson’s ‘How Deep is the Distinction between A Priori and A Posteriori Knowledge?’, reprinted in Boghossian and Williamson (2020), who argue it isn’t, and Casullo’s (2015) reply.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-8">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Much of what we know and justifiedly believe we come to know or to have justification for believing by accepting what others tell us, i.e. <em>through testimony</em>. But how exactly does the acquisition of knowledge and justification through testimony work? According to <em>reductionists</em>, it is a matter of acquiring other beliefs providing us with good reasons for accepting the speaker’s testimony, putting us in the position to offer arguments of the form, “<em>S said that P</em>; <em>S’s testimony to P is reliable</em>; so <em>P</em>.” (It’s called <em>reductionism</em> because it holds that testimonial knowledge and justification <em>reduce</em> to knowledge and justification acquired in other ways, namely perception and induction.) But reductionism is problematic. One objection—see, for instance, Coady (1992) and §5.2 of Lackey (2008)—is that, owing to limitations in what we can observe, we generally can’t take the relevant steps to verify speakers’ testimony. Reductionism thus seems to lead to scepticism. In response, reductionists try to argue we <em>can</em> establish the reliability of testimony. Lipton (1998) and Malmgren (2006), for example, appeal to inference to the best explanation, while Fricker (1994), in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, argues we have a capacity for monitoring speakers for trustworthiness. See also Kenyon (2013), arguing that context provides a lot more information than its critics suppose, and Ch. 2 and 3 of Faulkner (2011), defending reductionism against the charge of scepticism but arguing that it over-intellectualises testimony. <em>Nonreductionists</em> offer a different account of how the acquisition of knowledge and justification through testimony works, on which we have a special entitlement to believe what we are told, regardless of any reasons we might be able to offer in support of it. (It’s called <em>nonreductionism</em> because it holds that testimonial knowledge and justification <em>don’t</em> reduce to knowledge and justification acquired in other ways, but are instead epistemologically distinctive.) The details of their views often mirror positions you might have looked at in connection with <a href="#scepticism"><strong>SCEPTICISM</strong></a>. Burge (1993), in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, for example, holds that we have a default but defeasible entitlement to accept a speaker’s testimony, paralleling the dogmatist’s claim that we have a similar entitlement to accept perceptual appearances, while McDowell (1994) appeals to a form of epistemological disjunctivism to argue that we have an entitlement to presume that a speaker’s testimony expresses knowledge where doing so is not doxastically irresponsible. See also Coady (1992), arguing for nonreductionism on the basis of the intelligibility of testimony, and Goldberg (2007), arguing for a reliabilist-based nonreductionism. Perhaps the main criticism of nonreductionism is that it amounts to a licence for gullibility. Fricker (1994) provides a classic statement of the worry. See also §5.3 of Lackey (2008) and Ch. 5 of Faulkner (2011). Some theorists have tried to move beyond the opposition between reductionism and nonreductionism, developing hybrid views of various sorts. See especially the <em>dualism</em> of Lackey (2008) and the <em>trust theory</em> of Faulkner (2011)—though Faulkner argues that Lackey’s approach is in fact a form of reductionism. Faulkner’s theory draws on aspects of a further approach to the question of how the acquisition of knowledge and justification through testimony works: via <em>faith</em>. On the face of it, this might seem implausible: whether or not I place my trust in a speaker may have moral and, more broadly, practical implications, but does it really have epistemic implications? Moran (2005), in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, is an influential defence of the idea, which has connections with the issue of <a href="#epistemic_injustice"><strong>EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE</strong></a> too. For critical discussion, try Ch. 8 of Lackey (2008) and the response in §6.5 of Faulkner (2011). If you’re thinking about testimony in depth, you should also think about whether or not it only serves to “transmit” knowledge and justification—whether, roughly, the acquisition of knowledge or justification through testimony requires that the speaker knows or justifiedly believes it too. Nonreductionists like Burge and McDowell think that it does—though see Edwards (2000) for a discussion of whether Burge’s position, as stated, manages to secure this result. Lackey influentially argues that testimony can not just transmit but also <em>generate</em> knowledge, however. See, for instance, Ch. 2 of her (2008) and, for some critical discussion, Ch. 3 of Faulkner (2011).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-9">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The epistemology of disagreement is a relatively recent topic, emerging only in the past twenty five years or so out of debates in the philosophy of religion. The main question is whether the discovery that you disagree with an epistemic peer about some proposition ever provides you with reason to revise your doxastic attitudes towards it—to move from belief that P to suspension of judgement, say, or from a high credence in P to a lower one. Proponents of <em>steadfastness</em> argue that it doesn’t, while proponents of <em>conciliatorism</em> argue that it does, although different conciliatorists offer different accounts both of the conditions under which discovering such disagreement provides you with reason to revise and of the strength or weight of the reason that it provides. Elga (2007), like Feldman (2007) and Christensen (2007) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, defends an <em>equal weight</em> account, on which the discovery of disagreement always provides you with a reason for revising your current attitude that has equal weight with your reason for retaining it. Lackey (2010) defends a <em>justificationist</em> account, on which whether the discovery of disagreement gives you a reason for thinking your belief is mistaken depends on the strength of your antecedent justification for that belief: if it is sufficiently high, what you gain is a reason for thinking, not that your belief is mistaken, but that your interlocutor is not your epistemic peer after all. See also the <em>total evidence</em> account, defended by Kelly in his contribution to Feldman and Warfield, eds. (2010), on which your <em>first-order</em> evidence (evidence for and against a proposition) can at least partially defeat your <em>higher-order</em> evidence (evidence about your first-order evidence), including evidence flowing from the discovery of peer disagreement. This paper represents a change of mind for Kelly, who in his earlier (2005) paper, listed in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, appeals to the distinction between first- and higher-order evidence to defend a steadfast approach. See also Titelbaum (2015), defending Kelly’s earlier Right Reasons View, and Lasonen-Arnio (2014), discussing the signficance of higher-order evidence. For other defences of steadfastness, see van Inwagen (1996), appealing to considerations of private evidence, as well as Enoch (2010) and Wedgwood’s ‘Moral Evil Demons’ in Feldman and Warfield, eds. (2010), appealing to considerations of self-trust. Conciliatorism in one form or another is often motivated by appeal to examples, such as the restaurant case in Christensen (2007) and the horse race case in Elga (2007). More theoretical arguments focus on testimony and putative analogies with devices like thermometers—see Enoch (2010) for critical discussion of the latter. Feldman (2007) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> argues for conciliatorism on the basis of the <em>uniqueness thesis</em>, the claim that, for any body of evidence E and proposition P, there is at most one doxastic attitude towards P that is supported by E. For discussion, see Kelly (2010), Schoenfield (2014) and the debate between Kelly and White, ‘Can Evidence be Permissive?’, in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>. Problems for conciliatorism include the worry that it leads to scepticism and is self-defeating. See various of the papers in Machuca, ed. (2013) for more on conciliatorism and scepticism. For more on self-defeat, see Elga’s paper in Feldman and Warfield, eds. (2010), Littlejohn’s in Machuca, ed. (2013), and the papers by Christensen and Weatherson in Christensen and Lackey, eds. (2013).</p>

<p>For a classic presentation of the suggestion that there is a distinctive epistemological problem of other minds, concerning a contrast between how we know about our own minds and how we know about others’—what Gomes (2018) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> calls the <em>problem of sources</em>—see Ayers (1953). One response to it, offered by the likes of Mill and Russell, is to argue that our knowledge of other minds is based on an <em>inference</em> of some sort. For a recent discussion of this approach, try (2000). For classic criticism of it, see Putnam (1975). Another response is to argue our knowledge of other minds is <em>perceptual</em>. For discussion and defence of this approach, see McNeill (2012). For criticism, see McGinn (1984) and Parrott (2017). For the <em>conceptual</em> problem of other minds—the problem of explaining how we are able to think about others’ minds—see Strawson (1958) and Avramides (2001). For a recent volume of papers on the topic of knowledge of other minds, see Avramides and Parrott, eds. (2019).</p>

<p>The literature for this topic is huge. For discussion of Mackie, see the first paper by Jaegwon Kim in <b>S&amp;T</b> and Scriven (2007). For discussion of Lewis, see the second paper by Kim in <b>S&amp;T</b>, as well as the papers by Horwich and Bennett. In order to overcome difficulties with his (1973) view, Lewis developed a different counterfactual theory, which is presented in his paper ‘Causation as Influence’ in Collins, Hall, and Paul, eds. (2004). Menzies (2001/14) provides a great overview of the issues surrounding these and other counterfactual approaches. You should also have a look at other approaches to causation. Perhaps the main one is the interventionist approach, a non-reductionist counterfactual approach that draws on the work of the computer scientist Judea Pearl. Woodward (2001/16) is a good introduction. If you’re interested in probablistic approaches, see in the first instance Hitchcock (1997/2018). Another approach worth looking at is the physical process acccount defended by Wesley Salmon. See his paper in <b>S&amp;T</b>, though the best introduction is his (2002). His view has fallen out of favour somewhat recently, however. Part of its appeal was the promise of an account of preemption cases, but on further examination, it’s not so clear. There’s some nice discussion in Hall (2009). The other pieces in <b>S&amp;T</b> are recommended; the editors’ introduction and the papers by Davidson and Tooley are all essential reading. See also the debate between Carroll and Schaffer in <b>SH&amp;Z</b> over whether or not there’s anything more to causal necessity than mere regularity. Lastly, try Psillos (2003) for a good overview of the issues. It’s too advanced to count as introductory, but provides detailed discussion of the Core Reading and other important approaches, including interventionism.</p>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in more depth, the rest of Lewis (1986) is essential. The second chapter defends Lewis’s extreme realism from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. The fourth and final chapter defends counterpart theory, his alternative to the view that there are transworld identities. Loux, ed. (1979) is also very useful, collecting together various classic papers. Many of them defend what Vetter (2011) calls <em>classical actualism</em>, agreeing with Lewis that modality is to be explained in terms of possible worlds, but disagreeing with him in holding that possible worlds themselves may be explained in terms of actual entities—propositions (Adams), states of affairs (Plantinga), or properties (Stalnaker), for example. Sider (2003) is an accessible survey of some of the main issues, as is Melia (2003), an introduction for advanced undergraduates, discussing, among other things, Quinean scepticism about modality and <em>modalism</em>, the view that modality is to be understood, not in terms of quantification over possible worlds, but in terms of primitive modal operators, ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’. See also the debate in <strong>SH&amp;Z</strong> between Bricker, defending extreme realism, and Melia, defending actualism. Recent years have seen a proliferation of alternative approaches, and you’ll want to think about some of these too. Rosen (1990) defends <em>fictionalism</em>, the view that possible worlds are a useful fiction. Sider (2011) elaborates on the <em>quasi-conventionalism</em> that he sketches towards the end of his (2003) paper. Thomasson (2007) defends a form of <em>non-cognitivism</em> about modality—similar to the non-cognitivism you might already be familiar with from metaethics. Think also about the approaches of <em>new actualists</em>, who seek to explain modality in terms of actual entities, but without appeal to possible worlds. See Vetter (2011), discussing Fine’s <em>essentialist</em> approach as well as her own <em>dispositionalism</em>, for a discussion of some of the issues.</p>

If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the rest of Melia (2003) is very helpful, and the rest of Lewis (1986) essential: the second chapter defends Lewis's brand of modal realism from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views; the fourth and final chapter defends counterpart theory, his alternative to the view that there are transworld identities. Loux (1979) is also very helpful, containing a number of important papers on the issues, and a good introduction. Menzel (2013/16) is an accessible overview of the issues surrounding Lewis-style realism, abstractionism or ersatzism, and combinatorialism&mdash;the latter a view particularly associated with David Armstrong: see his (2004). <b>SH&Z</b> contains an accessible debate between Phillip Bricker and Joseph Melia, with Bricker defending concretism and Melia defending ersatzism. Also look at some alternative approaches. Rosen (1990) defends a fictionalist approach, while Melia (1992) is a critical discussion of modalism, the view, to a rough approximation, that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explained in terms of objects' essences. For an introduction to the issues surrounding *impossible* worlds, see Berto and Jago (2009/18).

Kripke (1980) is the source of his influential Humphrey objection to Lewis-style realism, and argues that the so-called problem of trans-world identity, pressed by Chisholm (1967) among others, is a pseudo-problem.

<p>For a general guide to the various issues in the philosophy of time, Dainton (2010) is hard to beat. If you’re working on the topic in more depth, I recommend you keep it to hand as you work through the main debates. Inspired by McTaggart, these are usually posed in terms of a distinction between A-theorists, like Prior, and B-theorists, like Mellor. Zimmerman, ed. (2004) contains some now-classic discussions of the main A-theory, <em>presentism</em>, while Prosser (2017) is a recent book-length defence of the B-theory, focused on explaining various aspects of our experience of time that seem to tell against the view. You’ll also find an accessible debate between Dean Zimmerman and Jack Smart in <b>SH&amp;Z</b>, with Zimmerman defending presentism and Smart defending the B-theory. Think also about other A-theories, however, particularly the so-called <em>growing block</em> and <em>moving spotlight</em> views. There is some relatively recent discussion of the former in Bennett and Zimmerman, eds. (2014); the latter has long been regarded the poor relation among A-theories, but see Cameron (2015) for a recent and influential attempt to revive it. In thinking more about McTaggart, start with Dummett (1960), an influential discussion and partial defence of the argument for the unreality of time. Then try Fine (2006), a fantastic paper, offering an interesting interpretation of Dummett’s position. Be warned, however: the Fine’s hard going—and the Dummett’s harder than it might initially seem. Lastly, to think more about issues in the philosophy of time, you might also think about <a href="#time_travel"><strong>TIME TRAVEL</strong></a>.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-14">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>To at least a first approximation, the problem of change arises out of the fact that we understand persistence through change to be a matter of one and the same object having incompatible properties. Yet no object <em>can</em> have incompatible properties. Isn’t persistence through change, as we understand it, therefore impossible? Standard responses to the problem accept that no object can have incompatible properties, but insist that this can be reconciled with a correct understanding of persistence through change. Different theorists attempt the reconciliation in different ways, however, offering more or less revisionary accounts of persistence through change: perdurantists, like Lewis, argue that it is a matter of one and the same object having different <em>temporal parts</em> with incompatible properties; exdurantists (also known as stage theorists), like Sider, argue that it is a matter of different <em>temporal counterparts</em> having incompatible properties; while endurantists, like Haslanger, argue (roughly) that it is a matter of one and the same object having incompatible properties itself but at different <em>times</em>. <strong>H&amp;K</strong> contains many classic papers on the issues, usefully arranged into thematic groups. <strong>SH&amp;Z</strong> is also useful, containing a paper by Sider defending exdurantism and a paper by Hawthorne attacking the idea that the debate should be regarded as one about whether or not temporal parts (or counterparts) exist. See also Macbride (2001), arguing that the debate overlooks various alternative accounts of change; Koslicki (2003), on Sider’s argument from vagueness; and Magidor (2016), arguing that a host of argument offered in the literature are strictly orthogonal to the debate between endurantists and perdurantists. You might also want to think about overlap between this topic and <strong>OBJECTS</strong>. See, e.g., McGrath (2007) on the argument from coincidence or co-location. Lastly, you might want to think about some non-standard responses to the problem. Priest (2006) argues there are good reasons for thinking change produces <em>dialethias</em>, or true contradictions, while Hofweber (2009) and Einheuser (2012) argue there’s no real problem of change in the first place, only a <em>meta</em>-problem.</p>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in more depth, Locke’s discussion in his <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (Bk II, Ch. 27) is essential reading, as are the famous replies from Thomas Reid and Joseph Butler. These are usefully collected, along with various other pieces, in Perry, ed. (2008). You’ll also want to think a bit about Williams. For some discussion, see the piece by Nozick in <strong>M&amp;B</strong>, Noonan (1982), and John Perry’s piece ‘Williams on The Self and the Future’ in Perry, ed. (2008). Otherwise, you should focus on Parfit and animalism. <strong>M&amp;B</strong> contains a number of pieces discussing Parfit: those by Lewis, Korsgaard, Unger, Sosa, Martin, Schechtman, and Johnston, as well as Parfit’s own ‘The Unimportance of Identity’. Lewis’s response is particularly important, and will seem less <em>ad hoc</em> if you’ve encountered his views on persistence more generally. For discussion of animalism, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Snowdon (1990) is an important statement and defence of the position. For other discussions, see Olson (2004), Shoemaker (2008), Madden (2011), and the collection, Blatti and Snowdon, eds. (2016)—the last containing a piece by Parfit arguing against animalism.

Another thing to think about is time travel. Is it possible? Does it pose a problem for particular views about time? Lewis (1976) is a classic, arguing that it's possible. And see Vihvelin (1996) for discussion, and Wasserman (2017) for a recent book on the topic.

<p>In working further on this topic, you could do worse than work through the chapters of Part 2 of Berto and Plebani (2015), looking more closely at individual papers defending the views they discuss. Try the paper by Kris McDaniels in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009) for an example of the Ontological Pluralism discussed in Ch. 4, and Linnebo (2012) for an example of Neo-Fregeanism. For the Neo-Carnapianism discussed in Ch. 5, try Hirsch (2002), Thomas Hofweber’s paper in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), and Thomasson (2008). Fictionalism, discussed in Ch. 8 of Berto and Plebani (2015), is defended by Stephen Yablo in the piece above. For Meinongianism, discussed in Ch. 7, start with Reicher (2006/19). Fine (2012) is an example of the Grounding Approach discussed in Ch. 8. You’ll find other various useful papers in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), along with a handy editors’ introduction. Two other recommendations: Lewis and Lewis (1970), a dialogue between two philosophers discussing whether there are holes, is a must-read, while Effingham (2013) is a fantastic introductory book, aimed at undergraduates and discussing issues of meta-ontology in relation to debates in specific areas of metaphysics. It can be profitably read in working further not just on meta-ontology, but also on topics such as <a href="#possible_worlds"><strong>POSSIBLE WORLDS</strong></a>, <a href="#time"><strong>TIME</strong></a>, and <a href="#persistence"><strong>PERSISTENCE</strong></a>.</p>
