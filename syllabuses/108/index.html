<h1 id="philosophy-of-logic-and-language">Philosophy of Logic and Language</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for eight tutorials in Philosophy of Logic and Language. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="general-information">GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Before writing your essay, you should read <strong>all</strong> of the Core Reading for the topic unless otherwise indicated. (I’ve suggested a number of introductory readings for each topic. These are marked with a star: *. You needn’t read all of these. Pick whichever you find most useful.) Your essay and tutorial is only a first step towards an understanding of a topic, however. For finals, you will need to be able to answer any question that is set on around five topics, and you should use the Further Reading suggestions, in conjunction with the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/108%20Philosophy%20of%20Logic%20and%20Language.pdf">Faculty Reading list</a>, in vacations to work on the topics that most interest you.</p>

<p>Plan your essay out <strong>before</strong> you do any reading. That might seem back to front: you haven’t done any reading, so how can you plan out what you’ve got to say? But as soon as you know what the essay question is, you can form some idea of the questions you need to be thinking about, and these will structure both your essay, at least in a preliminary way, and your reading. You can, and most likely will, revise your essay plan as you do the reading.</p>

<p>In addition to an essay, you should also be compiling notes, stating the main positions or puzzles relating to the week’s topic, with bullet points summarising their pros and cons. You should revise and supplement these notes after the tutorial and as you read and attend lectures on the subject over the rest of your time in Oxford. They are much more important than your essay. Your essay is a snapshot of your understanding of the topic at a particular time, taken from the particular angle determined by the essay question. In your exams, your answers will be snapshots of a much deeper understanding taken from a different angle - they will be answers to different questions! Your notes should be improving with your understanding.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<h2 id="course-plan">COURSE PLAN</h2>
<p>The first four tutorials will cover some central issues in the philosophy of language. The remaining four will decided in consultation with students.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Dummett (1975) and McDowell (1977) are sympathetic (and contrasting) discussions of Frege’s distinction, both helpfully setting the issues in the broader context of thinking about theories of meaning. They’re both fairly hard going, however, and perhaps best left till after the end of term. Braun (1993) and Thomasson (2003) defend accounts of the apparent meaningfulness of, respectively, empty and fictional names. On empty names, Ch. 2 and 3 of Sainsbury (2005), above, are also essential.  </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Neale (1990) is a must-read explanation and defence of Kripke’s line. The analysis of definite descriptions has become a key battleground in debates over the semantics/pragmatics distinction. For two essential reads here, see Recanati (1993) and Stanley and Szabó (2000). See also the response to Stanley and Szabó from Neale and Bach in the same issue. It is probably fair to say that, in contemporary work, linguists have preferred a Strawsonian approach to definite descriptions. For an influential discussion, see von Fintel (2004).</p>

Reference and Descriptions Revisited Frank Jackson
-->
<p>If you are pushed for time, you can skim the Evans, and postpone the second part of the essay question for vacation work. Focus on getting clear on Kripke’s arguments against the descriptive theory, and whether they are successful.  </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
McCulloch (1989) is an accessible and extremely useful discussion of this and other topics we’ve been looking at so far this term. Jackson (1998) is an influential two-dimensionalist response to Kripke’s arguments. Jeshion (2002) focuses on the epistemological argument. Burgess (2014) is a short piece discussing the causal theory of reference and Evans. </p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Are names disguised definite descriptions?</p>

<p>What role, if any, do causal relations play in determining the referents of proper names?</p>

<p>Are there any reasons to think that the meaning of a proper name cannot be given by a rigidified definite description such as ‘The actual teacher of Alexander’?</p>

<!--Suppose that twins Sarah and Lisa are accidentally swapped as babies after their parents have named them both. Unbeknowst to anyone, the child originally named 'Sarah' grows up being called 'Lisa' and the child originally named 'Lisa' grows up being called 'Sarah'. Must the causal theory of reference predict that 'Sarah' refers to the child everyone calls 'Lisa' and vice versa?-->

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the problem of substitution of co-referring terms in belief reports? Is there a treatment of belief reports that is capable of accounting for it?</p>

<!--What problems do propositional attitude ascriptions pose for the principle of compositionality and semantic innocence? How, if at all, can they be solved?-->

<!--Is it possible to give an account of propositional attitude ascriptions that preserves both the principle of compositionality and semantic innocence? If not, how should they be accounted for?  -->

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Substitution failures seem to occur not just <em>inside</em> the scope of attitude verbs, but also outside and even in so-called simple sentences. See Richard (1983) for the first point, and Saul (1997) for the second. Crimmins and Perry (1989) discuss Richard’s puzzle, and defend a contextualist solution. Rumfitt (1993) is a refinement and defence of Davidson’s paratactic theory.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
‘Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly. Superman is identical to Clark Kent. Therefore, Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent can fly’. Is this a valid argument?</p>

<p>Do belief reports pose a problem for the principle that the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meaning of its constituents?</p>

<p>Does the proper name ‘Cicero’ have the same semantic role in the sentences ‘Cicero is an orator’ and ‘Alice believes that Cicero is an orator’?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Kirkham (1992) is an accessible overview of various issues related to this week’s topic. Field (1972) influentially argues that Tarski’s theory aims (but fails) to provide a definition of truth that would acceptable to physicalists. Sher (1999) discusses this and other challenges. Heck (1997) discusses the connection between Tarskian definitions of truth taken as, roughly, theories specifying the meanings of the sentences of the object-language and as theories of what ‘true’ means in the metalanguage. </p>
