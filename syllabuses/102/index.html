<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge &amp; Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything. </p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>. </p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, but I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of these. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you didn’t do the Gettier problem in 1st year, you may prefer to do the <a href="#analysis_of_knowledge">The Analysis of Knowledge</a> topic this week.</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the connection between Williamson’s claim that knowledge is a mental state and his claim that knowledge is unanalysable? Are these claims correct?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Zagzebski (1994) presents a recipe for constructing Gettier-style counterexamples to (certain sorts of) analyses of knowledge. (Jennifer Nagel introduces this and Williamson’s view in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll9xlNi2-mI">this video</a>.) Lowe (2002) is a useful review of <em>Knowledge and its Limits</em>, critically discussing Williamson’s claim that knowledge is a mental state. For more sympathetic discussion of the claim, see Yablo (2003) and Nagel (2013). Hyman (2014) criticises Williamson’s claim that knowledge is the most general factive stative attitude. </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
DeRose (2009) is an up-to-date statement and defence of contextualism. Brown (2006) defends an orthodox invariantist position, opposed both to contextualism and the subject-sensitive invariantism (SSI) endorsed by the likes of Hawthorne and Stanley. The debate between contextualism and SSI raises questions about the role of pragmatic elements in knowledge. Fantl and McGrath (2009) is a great discussion of this. Conee and Cohen (2014) is a useful debate for and against contextualism. It includes, among other things, discussion of whether contextualism provides a satisfactory response to scepticism. </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
The rest of Bonjour (1998) is very useful, particularly the first three chapters. Kripke (1980) famously argues against identifying <em>a priori</em> knowability with necessity, arguing that there are both <em>a posteriori</em> necessities and <em>a priori</em> contingencies. The relevant selections are reprinted in Paul Moser, ed. (1987) <em>A Priori Knowledge</em> (OUP), as is Quine (1951) and a number of other classic papers on this topic. Boghossian (1997) is an interesting and influential attempt to resuscitate an account of the <em>a priori</em> in terms of analyticity. Williamson (2011) argues that the <em>a priori</em>/<em>a posteriori</em> distinction is of “little theoretical significance”. Bonjour and Devitt (2014) debate whether anything is knowable <em>a priori</em>.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the first three chapters of David Lewis’s (1986) book are essential reading. The first lays out a case for his brand of modal realism, the second defends it from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. Bricker and Melia (2008) is a recent debate; they defend concretism and ersatzism respectively. The remaining suggestions all discuss other approaches. Rosen (1990) defends a fictionalist approach. Melia (1992) argues against modalism, the view (roughly) that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explicated in terms of objects’ essences. </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
The contrast between perdurance and endurance was first drawn by Mark Johnston in his PhD thesis. His (1987) discusses the problem of temporary intrinsics, and whether intrinsic properties can be understood as relations to times. Rea (1995) is a classic discussion of the problem of material constitution, posed by cases in which distinct objects appear to occupy the same space at the same time. Hawthorne (2008) and Effingham (2012) are two very useful discussions of various issues concerning persistence. Einheuser (2012) is a nice discussion of the question whether there is a genuine problem of change.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
‘The following two claims are in tension: (1) There can be change over time; (2) At least some non-essential properties of objects are intrinsic.’ Explain how this tension might most plausibly be thought to arise. How would you propose to resolve it? (2016)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) ‘Consider a headless statue called “HEADLESS”. Suppose that at some later time T HEADLESS has been augmented by attaching a head to it. Call the whole statue after this augmentation “HEADY”. Consider the portion of HEADY consisting of the whole statue except for its head, and call that object “HEADY-MINUS”. On the one hand, we should say that HEADLESS has gained a head and is thus identical to HEADY. On the other hand, we should say that HEADLESS is identical to HEADY- MINUS. But these statements cannot both be true.’ How should this quandary be resolved? <strong>OR</strong> (b) Are there any good reasons to prefer the view that objects persist by perduring rather than by enduring?

Fine (2006) is difficult but rewards the effort, arguing for the reality of tense. Lewis (1976) is a defence of the possibility of backwards time travel. Wasserman (2017) is a recently published book looking at a range of issues concerning time travel.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
How readily should one believe what others tell one? (2016)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) ‘Understanding other people’s eye-witness accounts affords one epistemic access to states of affairs they have observed and now report, in much the same way that one’s memory affords one present access to past states of affairs which one oneself once observed.’ Discuss. <strong>OR</strong> (b) To what extent does one’s dependence on others for much of what one knows compromise one’s ability to take responsibility for one’s own beliefs? (2015)</p>

<p>‘Insofar as observations could undermine our entitlement to trust testimony, so also testimonies could undermine our entitlement to trust particular observations.’ Is this true? Does it follow that testimony and observation are equally basic as sources of knowledge? (2013)</p>

<p>Can there be such a thing as knowledge by testimony alone? (2011)</p>

Yablo (1998) is an early articulation of a fictionalist approach to meta-ontology. For contemporary Quinean and Carnapian approaches, see van Inwagen (1998) and Thomasson (2009), respectively. For ontological pluralism — not to be confused with the Carnapian approach, which confusingly also sometimes goes by the same name — see McDaniel (2009). Berto and Plebani (2015) discuss all these and various other approaches, and defend the Quinean position, which they call the Standard View.</p>

Forbes (1985) argues that unless things have non-trivial individual essences, transworld identities will be problematically ungrounded. Mackie (2006) discusses Forbes. Lewis (1986) discusses his counterpart theory in more detail. Fara and Williamson (2005) argues against it. (Be warned: this paper is quite technical.) 

Fine (1994) discusses something related to issues of transworld identity, arguing that facts about an object's essential properties cannot be understood in terms of facts about its modal properties (such as its having that property in every possible world), but rather vice-versa: facts abouts its modal properties have to be understood in terms of its essential properties.
