<h1 id="early-modern-philosophy">EARLY MODERN PHILOSOPHY</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Early Modern. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover four topics on <strong>DESCARTES</strong> (<a href="#doubt">Doubt</a>, <a href="#cogito">The Cogito</a>, <a href="#circle">The Circle</a>, and <a href="#dualism">Cartesian Dualism</a>), two on <strong>BERKELEY</strong> (<a href="#immaterialism">Immaterialism</a> and <a href="#berkeley_god">God and Reality</a>), and two on <strong>HUME</strong> (<a href="#induction">Reason and Induction</a> and <a href="#causation">Causation</a>). But this is not set in stone, and I have provided some suggestions for alternative topics. If you want to cover some of these or something else instead, let me know, and I’ll see what we can do. Note that topics you may have covered in doing General Philosophy in first year, and so might want to leave for self-study in vacations, are marked with a dagger (†).</p>

<p>The reading for each topic is divided into two parts. In writing your tutorial essay, focus on the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, using as a guide the more introductory texts marked with a star (*) and any Faculty lectures on the topic—the lectures are often available online via <a href="http://www.canvas.ox.ac.uk/">Canvas</a>, and are a good indication of what might come up in the exams. You can then look at the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, as well as anything else on the <a href="https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/79059/files/2372572?wrap=1">Faculty Reading List</a>, when exploring topics in more depth during later vacations.</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Early Modern Philosophy to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. I’m grateful to various friends and colleagues for advice and discussion, especially Alexander Douglas, Steph Marston, and Peter Millican. If you’d like to use the list for teaching, please feel free. Feedback and corrections are gratefully received!</p>

<h4 id="vacation-reading-and-set-texts">VACATION READING and SET TEXTS</h4>

<p>For this paper, you will need to be able to answer questions on at least one of Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz and at least one of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. The set texts are Descartes’ <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em> (1641), Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em> (1677), Locke’s <em>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (1689), Leibniz’s <em>Discourse on Metaphysics</em> (1686) and <em>Monadology</em> (1714), Berkeley’s <em>Principles of Human Knowledge</em> (1710) and <em>Three Dialogues</em> (1713), and Book One of Hume’s <em>Treatise of Human Nature</em> (1739/40).</p>

<p>Unless otherwise agreed, we will be focusing on Descartes’ <em>Meditations</em>, Berkeley’s <em>Principles</em> and <em>Three Dialogues</em>, and the first book of Hume’s <em>Treatise</em>. <em>Familiarity with these set texts is absolutely essential</em>. You will therefore need to buy your own copy of each, and read it through in its entirety in the vacation beforehand. There are several different editions—and, where applicable, translations—of them out there, and quality varies, so it is important that you get hold of the right ones. I can recommend the following:</p>

<p>While most of the readings can be obtained online, it’s useful to have good anthologies and collections of papers on the authors we’re studying, so as to be able to read around a bit more widely.

<h4 id="essay-question">ESSAY QUESTION</h4>

<p>What are the sceptical hypotheses of the First Meditation? What does each hypothesis call into doubt? Why does Descartes have the meditator engage in the project of raising them? Is the project well-motivated? <!--How, if at all, does Descartes eventually answer each of the doubts? Is his strategy viable, at least in principle? --></p>

Descartes: <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> (<b>Meditations</b> pp. 3-62, <b>CSM</b> II pp. 3-62, <b>SPW</b> pp. 73-122); <i>Selections from the Objections and Replies</i>, On Meditation One (<b>Meditations</b> pp. 63-7, <b>SPW</b> pp. 123-6).  
</p>

</div>

<p>For this, your first week on Descartes’s <em>Meditations</em>, you should start by reading the whole thing—it’s only 60 pages or so—to get a sense of how the sceptical hypotheses of the First Meditation structure the rest of the text. Then go back and work through the First Meditation more carefully, before tackling the corresponding <em>Selections from the Objections and Replies</em>. (We will talk in tutorials and classes about strategies for getting a preliminary grip on texts like the <em>Meditations</em>.) After all that—but <em>only</em> after that—work through whatever of the following secondary reading you can manage, starting with the selection from Hatfield’s book, which, as explained above, is marked with a star (*) to indicate that it’s more introductory. You needn’t read all three of them just now—though by all means do if you have the time. Come back later to anything that you miss.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In pursuing topics for this paper in more depth, you’ll find various other primary texts helpful. For Descartes, these include the two other major philosophical works he published in his lifetime, <em>Discourse on the Method</em> (1637) and <em>Principles of Philosophy</em> (1644), and the <em>Conversations with Burman</em> (1648). For each topic, I will specify the relevant further primary texts as I do here, at the top of the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, following it up with suggestions for further secondary reading. Of the further secondary reading for this week, Blumenfeld and Blumenfeld (1978) and Stroud (1982) may be familiar to you already from first year work for General Philosophy, setting out and defending interpretations of the dreaming argument. Curley (1978) has a similar focus. See also Foucault (2006), discussing the contrast in status in the First Meditation between dreams and madness. Carriero (2009) and Frankfurt (1970) are, like Williams (1978) and Wilson (1978) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, more wide ranging, covering various themes arising out of the First Meditation. Burnyeat (1982) is a classic, and especially important if you are also studying Berkeley for this paper, arguing that Berkeley’s immaterialism only became so much as conceivable after Descartes’s repurposing of the materials of classical scepticism. Williams (1986) is developed partly in response, arguing that Descartes’s radicalisation of classical scepticism, far from emerging naturally out of common sense reflection, as Descartes himself presents it, in fact relies on substantive and controversial foundationalist assumptions. You’ll find interesting critical discussion of Williams in Broughton (2002)—see Ch. 5 in particular. See also Larmore’s papers in <a href="#Gaukroger"><strong>Gaukroger</strong></a> and <a href="#Cunning"><strong>Cunning</strong></a>, Cunning’s own contribution to <a href="#Cunning"><strong>Cunning</strong></a>, and Owens’ paper in <a href="#B&amp;C"><strong>B&amp;C</strong></a>. Though it isn’t something he explicitly discusses, Owens’ piece is very helpful for thinking about how Descartes’s views on scepticism and belief or judgement contrast with those of Hume, who you may also be studying this term.</p>

<!-- Nice discussion of the dreaming argument, offering a reconstruction and defence of it, and arguing that Descartes's own response ultimately fails. Descartes, like the coherence empiricist, rejects the last step of the argument on the grounds that something other than intrinsic features of our experience justifies our claim to certainty about the external world. (The coherence empiricist appeals to the coherence of our experience; Descartes appeals to that *together* with the existence of a non-deceiving God.) But Descartes's argument, C thinks, founders on the fact that dreams can cohere with the rest of life. -->

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The Second Meditation raises various issues. First, is the <em>cogito</em> an inference? If not, what is it? Hintikka (1962) raises objections against inferential interpretations and argues for an alternative, <em>performative</em> one. Wilson (1978) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, by contrast, argues for an inferential interpretation. See also Frankfurt (1966), raising influential criticisms of Hintikka’s interpretation and an objection to the sort of <em>naive</em> inferential interpretation defended by Wilson, Ch. 3 of Kenny (1968), defending a hybrid approach, and Markie (1992), defending what he calls the <em>modified self-evident intuition/immediate inference</em> interpretation. You’ll also find discussion of the issue in some of the books listed in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#doubt"><strong>DOUBT</strong></a>. See especially Ch. 4 of Curley (1978), building on Frankfurt’s approach, and Ch. 7 of Broughton (2002), defending an inferential interpretation that interestingly differs from Wilson’s. Second, is the <em>cogito</em> sound? In particular, what, if anything, entitles the meditator to the claim <em>I think</em> rather than <em>there is some thinking going on</em>? Williams (1978), in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, contains, among other things, a classic defence of Descartes on this score. See also the rewarding discussion of the issue in Peacocke (2012). Third, in what sense, exactly, does the <em>cogito</em> serve as an Archimedean point in the subsequent Meditations? For discussion of this, see Beyssade (1993) as well as various of the pieces already mentioned. Cunning (2007), examining in what sense, if any, the meditator regards her existence as dubitable, is also relevant here, connecting with issues you can look at in connection with <a href="#circle"><strong>THE CIRCLE</strong></a>. Connecting with issues you can look at in studying <a href="#dualism"><strong>CARTESIAN DUALISM</strong></a>, think also about how far Descartes take himself to have got in the Second Meditation towards establishing the claim that thought alone belongs to his essence. See Schiffer (1976), as well as Ch. 4 of Kenny (1968), Ch. 4 of Williams (1978), Wilson (1978) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, Rozemond’s paper in <a href="#Gaukroger"><strong>Gaukroger</strong></a>, and Alanen’s in <a href="#Cunning"><strong>Cunning</strong></a>. Lastly, what exactly is the discussion of the piece of wax towards the end of the Second Meditation supposed to contribute? See Schmitter (2000), as well as the discussion in Wilson (1978) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and in Morris’s paper in <a href="#Cunning"><strong>Cunning</strong></a>. You’ll find general discussion of the Second Meditation in Ch. 2 of Carriero (2009), listed in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#doubt"><strong>DOUBT</strong></a>.

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The problem this week is an apparent circularity in Descartes’s reasoning in the <em>Meditations</em>. He seems to be arguing from clearly and distinctly perceived premises to the intermediary conclusion that God exists and is not a deceiver, and from there to the final conclusion that whatever is clearly and distinctly perceived is true. But isn’t this to try to prove the veracity of clear and distinct perception by presupposing that very claim? There are two main approaches, and if you’re thinking about the topic in depth, you’ll want to get clear on the problems and prospects of both. On a <em>bounded doubt</em> interpretation, certain propositions, including the premises of the proof that God exists and is not a deceiver, are immune to the evil demon doubt, and are known with certainty by meditator from the outset. This is the strategy pursued by Della Rocca (2005) and Rickless (2005). See also Ch. 8 of Kenny (1968), Ch. III of Wilson (1978), and Ch. 9 of Broughton (2002) in the <strong>CORE</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#doubt"><strong>DOUBT</strong></a> and <a href="#cogito"><strong>THE COGITO</strong></a>. On an <em>unbounded doubt</em> interpretation, the evil demon doubt applies universally, but undermines the propositions that one clearly and distinctly perceives only indirectly, when one is not attending to them. This is the strategy pursued by Newman and Nelson (1999) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and van Cleve (1979), Loeb (1992), and Sosa (1997). See also Ch. 5 of Curley (1978) and §III of Ch. 5 of Carriero (2009) in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#doubt"><strong>DOUBT</strong></a>, as well as Carriero’s contribution to <a href="#B&amp;C"><strong>B&amp;C</strong></a>. Think also about approaches that deny Descartes was trying to show that clear and distinct perception is veracious in the first place. One such approach, defended in Doney (1955), but subjected to decisive criticism in Frankfurt (1962), has it that he was rather trying to show that <em>memory</em> is reliable. Another, defended by Frankfurt himself in his (1978) piece in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and elsewhere, has it that Descartes was trying to show only that clear and distinct perception is self-validating. For some discussion of Frankfurt, see again Ch. 5 of Curley (1978) in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#doubt"><strong>DOUBT</strong></a>, as well as Lennon (2008) and Newman’s reply to Frankfurt (1978) in <a href="#D&amp;L"><strong>D&amp;L</strong></a>. See also Gewirtz (1941), an important influence on Frankfurt and an early and often cited classic on this week’s topic.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-5">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>There are two main questions to think about this week. First, how does Descartes argue for a real distinction between mind and body? The standard interpretation of his central argument—set out in Ch. 4 of Williams (1978) and §3 of Wilson (1978) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>—involves a puzzling move from the claim ‘I do not clearly and distinctly perceive that I am extended’ to the claim ‘I clearly and distinctly perceive that I am not extended’. An alternative interpretation, developed in Ch. 1 of Rozemond (1998) and summarised in her contribution, ‘Descartes’s Dualism’ in <a href="#B&amp;C"><strong>B&amp;C</strong></a>, tries to make do with the weaker claim, and appeal instead to a certain metaphysics of substance, mode, and attribute. See also Dutton (2003), arguing that a central plank of Rozemond’s interpretation lacks textual support. For other discussions of Descartes’s arguments, see Ch. 4 of Kenny (1968), Schiffer (1976), Ch. 7 of Curley (1978), and Ch. 2 and 6 of Carriero (2009), listed as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for either <a href="#doubt"><strong>DOUBT</strong></a> or <a href="#cogito"><strong>THE COGITO</strong></a>. The second question is whether the view that there is a real distinction between mind and body faces insurmountable objections. Historically, the main worry has been that, in holding that there is a real distinction, Descartes cannot account for the possibility of causal interactions between mind and body. When pressed on this by Elisabeth of Bohemia, Descartes appealed to a “primitive notion” of mind-body union, but many commentators have found this problematic. Besides Wilson (1978) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, see Radner (1971), a pioneering English-language piece on the issue, and Garber (1983). Others argue that Descartes’s position commits him to a form of <em>trialism</em>, the view that there are <em>three</em> radically different kinds of created substance. See Cottingham (1985) and Hoffman (1986), attributing to Descartes a form of Aristotelian <em>hylomorphism</em>. For critical discussion of these views, see in the first instance Yandell (1997). See also Brown in <a href="#D&amp;L"><strong>D&amp;L</strong></a>, replying to Garber, and Ch. 5 of Rozemond (1998) and Kaufman (2008), replying to Hoffman. Hoffman replies in his ‘The Union and Interaction of Mind and Body’ in <a href="#B&amp;C"><strong>B&amp;C</strong></a>, defending his interpretation of Descartes as endorsing hylomorphism, and arguing that the interaction problem is no worse for Descartes than it is for others. The topic raises issues concerning the will, discussed in Ch. 10 of Williams (1978) in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, and causation, which you can explore further in studying Hume on <a href="#causation"><strong>CAUSATION</strong></a>.

## 1. DOUBT and the COGITO
[TOP](#top)

#### ESSAY QUESTION  
What is Descartes trying to achieve with his Meditations? What are his principal objectives and conclusions? What function do the sceptical arguments play, and how does Descartes attempt to answer them? What is the intended role of the *cogito*, and what is it about the *cogito* that makes it suitable for this role? Is Descartes’ procedure viable, at least in principle?

</p>

</div>

#### FURTHER READING  

Your main task for this week is to read through the entirety of the *Meditations*, getting a sense both of how it all hangs together and of what Descartes' overall aims in writing it might have been. Hatfield (2003), in the Core Reading, is a good guide, distinguishing epistemological, metaphysical, and cognitive interpretations. The first three essays in **Rorty** are also helpful here. The fifth essay, by Michael Williams, focuses on the method of doubt. It's reprinted in **Oxford Readings: Descartes**, and discussed in Ch. 5 of Broughton (2002). Broughton's book is also suggested in connection with the next two topics, and is well worth reading in its entirety. At a more fine-grained level, you will want a good understanding of the various sceptical arguments of Meditation One and the famous *cogito* of Meditation Two. For classic discussions of the former, and more specifically, of the dreaming argument, see Blumenfeld and Blumenfeld (1978) and Stroud (1982). For discussion of Meditation One more generally, see Frankfurt (1970). Hintikka (1962) and Markie (1992) are classic pieces on the *cogito*. For more recent discussions of the sceptical arguments of Meditation One and the *cogito* of Meditation Two, try Owens (2000) and Peacocke (2012) respectively. Lastly, for an overview, try sections 1 to 4 of Newman (1997/19).

#### PAST PAPER QUESTIONS

What role does the *Cogito* play in the strategy of the *Meditations*, and is Descartes’s appeal to it legitimate? (2019)  

Was Descartes' method of doubt properly executed? Are there any matters he should have called into doubt but did not? Are there any matters he did call into doubt but should not have? (2018)

Does it seem plausible to think that the meditator will find herself in the position that Descartes claims she will by the end of the First Meditation? (2017) 

‘If he were deducing \[existence from thought\] by means of a syllogism, he would have to have had previous knowledge of the major premiss “Everything which thinks is, or exists”; yet in fact he learns it from experiencing in his own case that it is impossible that he should think without existing. It is in the nature of our mind to construct general propositions on the basis of our knowledge of particular ones.’ (DESCARTES, Second Set of Replies) Discuss. (2017)

Why did Descartes employ the method of doubt? Should he have? (2016)

#### ESSAY QUESTION  
How, and why, does Descartes argue for the existence of God in the Third Meditation and then again in the Fifth Meditation? What, if anything, is wrong with these arguments? Does Descartes have a plausible account of why, if God is not a deceiver, we nevertheless make mistakes? 

NOTE: Set out brief answers to each part of the question, and offer a more in depth discussion of the issues arising out of **one** of the three Meditations&mdash;whichever one you find most interesting.

</p>

</div>

#### FURTHER READING  

There's a lot of ground to cover this week, as with last week. It's best to distinguish three different topics to think about: the broadly speaking cosmological arguments for the existence of God in Meditation Three, the attempt to address the problem posed by error in Meditation Four, and the ontological argument for the existence of God in Meditation Five. (Meditations Three to Five raise various other issues you might want to think about&mdash;concerning, for instance, innate ideas, modality, essences, and, especially, the Cartesian circle&mdash;but focus on these first.) There are various relevant papers in **Rorty**; Margaret Wilson's paper (on the cosmological arguments) and David Rosenthal's (on the problem of error) are especially recommended&mdash;the latter is reprinted in **Chappell**. For more discussion of the cosmological arguments, also see O'Toole (1993), Broughton (2002), and Machamer and McGuire (2009). For discussion of the problem of error, and the related issue of Descartes' conception of freedom, see Kenny (1972), Chappell (1994), and Christofidou (2013). Nolan (2001/15) is an overview of issues surrounding the ontological argument, and Beyssade (1992) a general discussion of Descartes's thinking about God.

#### PAST PAPER QUESTIONS  

Can Descartes be defended in his claim that we possess an idea of God of such a character that we could not have produced it ourselves? (2019)  

In what sense does Descartes hold that judgement involves the faculty of choice or freedom of the will? (2019)  

Critically compare the views of Descartes and at least one other author covered by this paper, on the topic of *the Ontological Argument*. (2019)  

Critically compare and contrast Spinoza’s and Descartes’ versions of their ontological argument. (2018)

Does Descartes have a conception of freedom of the will that can be applied
consistently to God and to created thinking substances? (2017)

Is Descartes’ argument for God’s existence in the Third Meditation at all plausible? (2017)

‘\[W\]hen I look more closely at myself and inquire into the nature of my errors (for these are the only evidence of some imperfection in me), I notice that they depend on two concurrent causes, namely on the faculty of knowledge which is in me, and on the faculty of choice or freedom of the will; that is, they depend on both the intellect and the will simultaneously.’ (DESCARTES, Fourth Meditation) Discuss.

[TOP](#top)

#### ESSAY QUESTION

What are the principal features of Leibniz's account, in his so-called "middle period", of the nature of substance? What is the relationship between this account and his theory of truth? How, if at all, do Leibniz's views about whether any material objects are substances change during this period?

</div>

#### FURTHER READING

The view that Leibniz derives his metaphysics from his "logic" (that is, his theory of truth) goes back to the early 20th century, and work by Bertrand Russell and Louis Couturat. Couturat's paper in **Frankfurt** is a classic statement of the view. See also Broad (1975, pp. 20-5), Fleming (1985), Parkinson (1965, Ch. 3), and Rutherford (1995, pp. 119-24 and 138-54) for discussion. You'll find good discussions of Leibniz's views about the nature of substance in Parkinson (1965, Ch. 5), Rutherford (1995, pp. 133-48), and Woolhouse (1993). <!--See also Mercer and Sleigh's contribution to **Jolley**, discussing how Leibniz came to his views. Garber's view that Leibniz came to endorse a form of realism in his correspondence with Arnauld is widely discussed in the recent literature.  See especially Sleigh (1990) and Wilson (1989), both broadly sympathetic, and Adams (1994) and Rutherford (1995, Ch. 10), both more or less critical of Garber's view. See also Broad (1975, Ch. 3) for an earlier approach along the same lines as Garber's, and the overview of the debate in §2 of the Editors' Introduction to **PT**. Garber has since modified his views; see Lodge (2005) for relevant references and discussion.

<h4 id="past-paper-questions-7">PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</h4>
<p>Berkeley suggests that the doctrine of abstract ideas has ‘had a chief part in rendering speculation intricate and perplexed, and … occasioned innumerable errors and difficulties in almost all parts of knowledge.’ (<em>Principles of Human Knowledge</em>, Introduction, §6) Why did Berkeley think it so important to attack abstract ideas, and how far does the rest of his theory depend on their rejection? (2019)</p>

<p>‘Upon the whole, I am inclined to think that the far greater part, if not all, of those difficulties which have hitherto amused philosophers, and blocked up the way to knowledge, are entirely owing to ourselves. That we have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see…. In order to prepare the mind of the reader for the easier conceiving what follows, it is proper to premise somewhat, by way of Introduction, concerning the nature and abuse of Language. But the unravelling this matter leads me in some measure to anticipate my design, by taking notice of what seems to have had a chief part in rendering speculation intricate and perplexed, and to have occasioned innumerable errors and difficulties in almost all parts of knowledge. And that is the opinion that the mind hath a power of framing <em>abstract ideas</em> or notions of things.’ (BERKELEY, <em>Treatise</em>, Introduction) Why was the attack on abstract ideas so important to Berkeley? (2018)</p>

<!--
What did Berkeley mean by saying an idea can be like nothing but an idea? Was he correct? (2018)  

Compare Berkeley on the concept of ‘idea’ with at least one other author covered in this paper. (2017) -->

<p>Does Berkeley’s critique of abstract ideas rest on the assumption that ideas are images? (2016)</p>

<p>If you are working on this topic in more depth, Stroud (1977), which sparked a renaissance of work on Hume, is a must-read. I’ll be suggesting chapters from it as Further Reading in connection with many of the other topics, too. Other classics for this topic include: Bennett’s contribution to <strong>Millican</strong>, a revised version of a chapter from his 1971 book, <em>Locke, Berkeley, Hume: Central Themes</em> (OUP); Everson (1988), arguing for a functional interpretation of Hume’s notions of force, vivacity, and liveliness; and Pears (1990), a difficult but rewarding discussion, arguing for a middle ground between positivist interpretations, like Bennett’s, and more naturalist interpretations, like Garrett’s and Stroud’s. More recent work includes Kail (2007), Landy (2006), and Schafer (2013). For Locke’s theory of ideas, which serves as important background to Hume’s theory of mind, see Chappell (1994). It’s worth thinking also about various connected topics: Hume’s associationism, treatment of abstract ideas, and theory of belief. (The latter’s particularly important in thinking about Hume’s approach to causation and causal necessity.) For discussion, try Bennett (2001, Ch. 33), Pears (1990, Ch. 4), Stroud (1977, pp. 68-76), and the opening few sections of Broackes’ paper in <strong>Millican</strong>.</p>

<p>Background on induction: Stroud (1977) is a classic, responding to the deductivist interpretation, of the likes of D. C. Stove. Non-sceptical readings emerged, see e.g. Broughton (1983). Took Hume to be trying to show only that induction isn’t founded on reason in a narrow sense. Criticised by both Garrett and Millican. Garrett’s views initially in his (1997), but developed in response to critics over the next few years; see his ‘Appendix: The Meaning of Hume’s Conclusion concerning “Inductive” Inferences’ in <strong>Millican</strong>. As Millican explains in his (2012) piece, this moves him close to Owen (1999). See Roth (2006) for an overview of the Garrett-Millican debate, among other things. See also Garrett and Millican (2011), discussing both induction and causation, next week’s topic. Other good recent papers on the topic include: Loeb (2008), Qu (2014).</p>

<p>Read and Richman, eds. (2008) is invaluable, containing both classics and essential new pieces on the topic. In addition to Strawson’s piece in the Core Reading, it contains important pieces that: defend the sceptical realist interpretation (Craig, Wright, Kail); criticise the sceptical realist interpretation (Winkler, Millican, Jacobsen); and defend the projectivist interpretation (Stroud, Blackburn—the latter is reprinted with a postscript in <strong>Millican</strong>). For a prominent defence of the reductionist interpretation, see Garrett (1997) and (2009). Stroud (1977) suggests the projectivist interpretation. Projectivism is also discussed, sympathetically, by Beebee (2006) and, critically, by Kail (2007). Millican (2009) develops his criticism of sceptical realism.</p>

T 1.3.15], that to consider the matter a priori, any thing may produce any thing, and that we shall never discover a reason, why any object may or may not be the cause of any other, however great, or however little the resemblance may be betwixt them. … we find … by experience, that [thought and motion] are constantly united; which being all the circumstances, that enter into the idea of cause and effect, when apply’d to the operations of matter, we may certainly conclude, that motion may
