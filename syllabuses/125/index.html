<h1 id="philosophy-of-cognitive-science">Philosophy of Cognitive Science</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Cognitive Science. Many of the readings are online, and all can be obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything. </p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/125_Philosophy_of_Cognitive_Science_Jan11.pdf">Faculty Reading list</a>.  </p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the following <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. Only the first six weeks are fixed, leaving us two weeks to pursue topics of your choosing. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. (I’ve also listed some <strong>SPECIAL TOPICS</strong>, which some students have wanted to explore in the past. These are less likely to come up in exams, but will deepen your understanding of other topics.) </p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the appeal of the thesis that the mind is the software of the brain? Is it true? Is it informative?</p>

Van Gelder (1995) presents an alternative <em>dynamic</em> approach to cognition. (This is often invoked in the Embodied Cognition tradition deriving from Merleau-Ponty and the ecological psychologist, J. J. Gibson. Clark discusses this in Ch. 7 of his (2001) book.) Rescorla (2015) is an excellent overview of a range of issues, covering much more than you need to know for this week, but it is well worth returning to it in subsequent weeks.  </p>

<p>NOTE: There tend not to be exam questions on exactly this topic, but it is important background to much else we’ll be looking at.

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
What is the frame-problem a problem for? Can it be overcome? (2016)</p>

<p>‘Both [computationalism and connectionism] assume that the mind is basically a cognitive engine and only secondarily a seat of emotion, feeling, and sensation.’ (CUMMINS) Is this true? If so, is it a fundamental problem for such theories? (2015)</p>

George (1986) is a short, useful clarification of what’s at stake between Quine and Chomsky. Davies (1987) defends and elaborates Evans’ attempt to meet Quine’s challenge. George (1989) is an edited volume. The contributions from George, Peacocke, and Davies are all relevant. Collins (2007) argues that linguistic competence should not be understood in terms of knowledge, tacit or otherwise, at all. </p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
Do rules play any role in our knowledge of language? (2016)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong>
(a) What are subdoxastic states? In what ways are they different from ordinary
psychological states like belief or knowledge?
<strong>OR</strong>
(b) Is the notion of ‘tacit knowledge’ trivial or can an appeal to tacit knowledge in the cognitive sciences help explain certain phenomena? (2014)</p>

<p>Is there any evidence to indicate that ordinary subjects have tacit knowledge of the grammatical rules of their language rather than merely behaving in conformity to those rules? (2013)</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What are Marr’s three levels of explanation and how do they relate to Cummins’ various notions of functional analysis, componential analysis, instantiation, and so on? In what sense(s), if any, is explanation in cognitive science independent of neuroscientific explanation?</p>

Peacocke (1986) argues for the need for a fourth level of explanation, intermediate between Marr’s computational and algorithmic levels.

Bechtel and Wright (2009) consider the extent to which the mechanistic perspective provides a unified account of psychological explanation. Weiskopf (2011) defends the view that psychological explanation need not be mechanistic.</p>

<p>In what sense, if any, can we study the mind/brain independently at each of Marr’s three levels of analysis and in what sense, if any, do the three levels constrain each other? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) ‘Each of the three levels of description will have its place in the eventual understanding of perceptual information processing, and of course they are logically and causally related.’ (MARR) ‘In Marr’s view, a higher level was independent of the levels below it.’ (CHURCHLAND &amp; SEJNOWSKI) Explain and discuss.

Laurence and Margolis (1997) address the objection that the LOTH involves a vicious regress. Matthews (2007) argues against the RTM/CTM more generally, which he calls the Received View.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
The whole of Fodor (1983) is essential reading for this topic if you are pursuing it in any depth. Pylyshyn (1999) is an important piece, arguing that vision is cognitively impenetrable, a thesis that is relevant to Fodor’s claim that input systems are modular. Jenkin and Siegel (2015) is a short survey of work on recent work on this issue. Fuller and Samuels (2014) is focused on Fodor’s claim that scientific inference is holistic. </p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
What does it mean to say that the mind is modular? What evidence is there to support the claim that it is? (2016)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) What is the empirical significance of the claim that the mind is modular? Is this claim well grounded in evidence?
<strong>OR</strong> (b) What in-principle challenges does the study of central cognitive processes face? (2015)</p>

<p>Explain what it means to say that belief fixation is isotropic and Quinean. Do these properties mean that we cannot fully explain how we come to form beliefs about the world? (2014)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong>
(a) Critically assess Fodor’s First Law of the Nonexistence of Cognitive Science: ‘The more global (e.g. the more isotropic) a cognitive process is, the less anybody understands it. Very global processes, like analogical reasoning, aren’t understood at all.’ (FODOR)
<strong>OR</strong>
(b) Drawing on a range of empirical examples, critically evaluate the claim that input systems are informationally encapsulated. (2013)</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
<strong>EITHER</strong> (a) Evaluate the case for single-factor and multi-factor accounts of delusional
thinking.
<strong>OR</strong> (b) To what extent are delusions like Capgras’ explicable by primary delusional experience? (2016)</p>

<p>Does making sense of delusions require us to postulate abnormalities in how beliefs are formed and maintained or does it suffice to appeal to abnormalities in perception or experience? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) Is it plausible that a single explanatory framework could account for the wide
variety of delusions?
<strong>OR</strong> (b) Critically discuss the following claim: ‘What we normally describe as the delusional belief that P ought sometimes to be described as the delusional belief that I believe that P.’ (CURRIE) (2014)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong>
(a) Are there good reasons for thinking that delusions are so irrational that they could
not be a type of belief? If they are not beliefs, what are they?
<strong>OR</strong>
(b) ‘The precipitating event is a perceptual impairment causing loss of normal affective reactions to the visual world, including such highly significant social stimuli as people’s faces.’ (STONE and YOUNG) If this were true, would it be sufficient to explain the Capgras delusion? (2013)</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Buller and Hardcastle (2000) argue against massive modularity on the grounds that empirical evidence suggests that brain structure is not innately specified. Peter Carruthers responds to this, and defends massive modularity at length, in his (2006) book. Wilson (2008) is a contribution to a symposium on this published by <em>Mind &amp; Language</em>. Among other things, Wilson discusses the so-called argument from animals. Rabaglia et al. (2011) present a challenge for massive modularity based on the so-called <em>positive manifold</em>, the fact that individuals who are high scoring in one cognitive domain tend to be high scoring on other cognitive domains. This suggests that high-level cognitive capacties are subserved by a single domain-general mechanism, rather than a range of domain-specific ones, as proponents of massive modularity claim. Robbins (2013) reviews the empirical evidence for massive modularity, and finds it wanting. </p>
