<h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Ethics. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, focusing mainly on normative ethics and some key contributions in the history of philosophy. We start with four weeks on the question of morality’s <em>content</em>, spending two weeks on consequentialism and deontology, the two main contemporary approaches to normative ethics, and two weeks on the moral theory of Kant, one of the main historical influences on deontology. These weeks raise important questions about practical reason and the normative <em>status</em> of morality—questions that we take up in more detail in the next two weeks, with a week looking at the challenge to morality posed by psychological and rational egoism and another on Hume’s ethics. The last two weeks return to the contemporary scene, bringing together what we’ve learnt over the previous six, and look at two different nonconsequentialist approaches to normative ethics, virtue ethics and contractualism. But the plan is not set in stone. I have also listed a range of <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>, and if you would like to cover any of these—or something else—let me know, and we’ll see what we can do. Topics you may have covered in doing the first year Moral Philosophy course, and so might want to leave for self-study in vacations, are marked with a dagger (†).</p>

<p>The reading for each topic is divided into two parts. In writing your tutorial essay, focus on the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, using as a guide the more introductory texts marked with a star (*) and any Faculty lectures on the topic—the lectures may be available online via <a href="http://www.canvas.ox.ac.uk/">Canvas</a>, and are a good indication of what might come up in the exams. You can look at the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, as well as anything else of relevance in the <a href="https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/119856/files/3013190/download?wrap=1">Faculty reading list</a>, when exploring topics in more depth during later vacations.</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of using previous incarnations in teaching Ethics to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. I’m grateful to various friends and colleagues for advice and discussion, especially Nadine Elzein, Edward Harcourt, Ulrike Heuer, Chris Jay, Ed Lamb, Mike Martin, Véronique Munoz-Dardé, Stefan Sienkiewicz, and Tom Sinclair. If you’d like to use the list for teaching, please feel free. Feedback and corrections will be gratefully received.</p>

<h4 id="vacation-reading-and-textbooks">VACATION READING and TEXTBOOKS</h4>

<p>If you are thinking about whether to take Ethics, or have decided to do so and want to do some preliminary reading over the vacation beforehand, take a look at some of the following introductory textbooks. (Note that earlier editions, where applicable, are cheaper and often just as good.)</p>

<div style="padding-left: 1em; text-indent: -1em;">

<p class="bibliography" style="margin-bottom:0;">
*Driver, Julia (2006) <a href="http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/oxford/detail.action?docID=1204064"><i>Ethics: The Fundamentals</i></a> (Blackwell).

</p>

<p class="last">
*Shafer-Landau, Russ (2021) <i>The Fundamentals of Ethics</i>, 5th ed. (OUP).
</p>

</div>

<p>For consolidation in later vacations, you might want something a little more advanced. The following are all recommended. They are no substitute for working through the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, however. To do well in any philosophy paper, you have to work through the details.</p>

<p>I also recommend that you take the opportunity to familiarise yourself beforehand, if you haven’t already, with these four classics of moral philosophy—the exam will offer you opportunities to display knowledge of them. We’ll be focusing on Hume’s <em>Treatise</em> and, especially, Kant’s <em>Groundwork</em>.</p>

<h4 id="anthologies-and-collections">ANTHOLOGIES and COLLECTIONS</h4>

<p>While most of the readings can be obtained online, it’s often useful to have good anthologies and collections of papers to hand, so as to be able to read around a bit more widely. The following are all recommended, containing many of the key readings and more besides, and are often referenced below.

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In thinking about this week’s topic in more depth, start perhaps with Brink’s overview in <a href="#Copp"><strong>Copp</strong></a>. Then get hold of a copy of <a href="#Scheffler"><strong>Scheffler</strong></a>, which collects together a series of classic papers that are invaluable in thinking about both this week’s topic and next’s. Besides the Williams, it contains two other important criticisms of consequentialism: Rawls, in a selection from his <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, ‘Classical Utilitarianism,’ (also reprinted in <a href="#Sher"><strong>Sher</strong></a>,) presents the influential objection that utilitarianism fails to respect the separateness of persons, while Nagel, in his ‘War and Massacre,’ presents a version of the objection that consequentialism is too permissive. Responses to the demandingness objection tend to fall into three categories: <em>extremists</em> argue the extreme demands consequentialism is alleged to make are not unreasonable, <em>denialists</em> argue that consequentialism doesn’t make the alleged demands anyway, while <em>reformists</em> argue that consequentialism can be reformulated in such a way as to avoid making them. Kagan (1989), listed as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for next week, <a href="#deontology"><strong>THE PARADOX of DEONTOLOGY</strong></a>, is a classic defence of extremism. Denialism tends to shade into reformism; Jackson (1991) is perhaps an example of the former while Railton’s indirect consequentialism, discussed and defended in Mason (1998), is perhaps an example of the latter. Other, more clearly reformist approaches include the hybrid approach developed in Scheffler (1993), also listed as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for next week’s topic—see especially pp. 1-22 and 55-70. See also rule consequentialism, defended by Hooker in, for example, his contribution to <a href="#LaFollette and Persson"><b>LaFollette and Persson</b></a> (and reprinted in <a href="#Shafer-Landau"><b>Shafer-Landau</b></a> and <a href="#Sher"><b>Sher</b></a>); satisficing consequentialism, critically discussed in Bradley (2006); and scalar consequentialism, defended by Norcross in his contribution to <a href="#Dreier"><b>Dreier</b></a> (and reprinted in <a href="#Sher"><b>Sher</b></a>). (<a href="#Dreier"><b>Dreier</b></a> also contains a couple of other pieces relevant to this week’s topic, by Shaw and Vallentyne.) For critical discussion of extremism, denialism, and reformism, see Mulgan (2001). For some critical discussion of Sobel’s treatment of the demandingness objection, try Woollard (2016). Williams’ objection is sometimes taken—in Ashford (2000), for example—as a version of the demandingness objection, though you should think carefully about whether that’s the best way to understand it; Ch. 4 of Hurley (2009), raising issues about the normative status of morality that we’ll be looking at soon, is useful in this regard. Another objection you might want to think about is the so-called <em>cluelessness</em> objection; see in particular Lenman (2000) and, for some critical discussion of it, Greaves (2016).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In comparison with consequentialism, contemporary deontology is rather undeveloped. In thinking about it further, start perhaps with Kagan (1998), an introduction to normative ethics focused on the debate between deontology and consequentialism. See also McNaughton and Rawling’s paper in <a href="#Copp"><b>Copp</b></a>, the papers suggested in connection with <a href="#harm"><strong>DOING and INTENDING HARM</strong></a>, and, if you’re feeling up to it, the rest of Kamm (2007). As Kamm mentions, its spiritual roots are the works of Kant, who we begin to look at next week, and W. D. Ross. Crudely put, where Kant was a monist and an absolutist, Ross was a pluralist and a moderate. (He also endorsed <a href="#moral_realism"><strong>MORAL REALISM</strong></a>, where Kant was arguably a kind of constructivist.) See especially Ch. 2 of Ross (1930/2002), as well as Stratton-Lake’s introduction and McNaughton and Rawling’s contribution to <a href="#LaFollette and Persson"><b>LaFollette and Persson</b></a>. In thinking specifically about the paradox of deontology, <a href="#Scheffler"><b>Scheffler</b></a> is again very useful. Besides the piece by Foot, see especially Scheffler’s introduction, Nozick’s ‘Side Constraints’, (also reprinted in <a href="#Shafer-Landau"><b>Shafer-Landau</b></a>,) Nagel’s ‘Autonomy and Deontology’, and Scheffler’s ‘Agent-Centred Restrictions, Rationality, and the Virtues’—a reply to Foot which is also reprinted as an appendix to his (1993) book. For some critical discussion of Kamm’s approach, see Lippert-Rasmussen (2009). Other recent discussions of the paradox include Chappell (2011), Hare (2013), and Heuer (2011). As Foot’s article makes clear, the flipside to the paradox is an argument for act consequentialism, based on the idea, roughly put, that it is always right to bring about the best. For some more critical discussion of this, see esp. Ch. 5 of Hurley (2009), which is listed as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for last week’s topic, <a href="#consequentialism"><strong>OBJECTIONS to CONSEQUENTIALISM</strong></a>. For influential arguments for rule consequentialism, see Parfit (2011a) and Hooker’s contribution to <a href="#LaFollette and Persson"><b>LaFollette and Persson</b></a>. Think also about the relationship between deontology and consequentialism. Some, like Dreier (1993), argue that deontology can be regarded as a non-standard form of consequentialism—one that adopts a certain agent-centred conception of the good. For critical discussion, bearing on the paradox of deontology, see Schroeder (2007).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>One piece to prioritise in thinking more about Kant and moral motivation is Baron (1995), defending Kant from the objection that he places too much value on acting from duty, though warning against thinking of him as exclusively concerned with what he calls the moral worth of an action. Baron insists that he’s in fact more interested in character and virtue. Other pieces to prioritise include Markovits (2010), who takes a similar line to Arpaly in the <strong>CORE READING</strong> and argues that what matters for the moral worth of an action is that the agent act for the reasons that make the act is right—the reasons <em>why</em> it is right—rather than for the reason <em>that</em> it is right, and Sliwa (2016), who responds in defence of the view that moral motivation requires both a concern for doing what is right and knowledge that the action is right. For extended discussion of the issues, see also Stratton-Lake (2000). See also the introductory overview by Johnson in <a href="Hill"><b>Hill</b></a>. The background worry is that orthodox approaches in ethics, such as Kant’s, are overly austere, allowing little room for personal relationships and ordinary human motivations. For an influential discussion of Kant’s ethics, in particular, see Williams (1976), raising the objection that Kant’s account of moral motivation involves “one thought too many”. See also Langton (1992), connecting with issues we’ll come to with the topic, <a href="#egoism"><strong>EGOISM: WHY BE MORAL?</strong></a>, and focusing on issues arising out of the correspondence between Kant and Maria von Herbert, who had written to Kant in a state of deep depression, seeking his advice. Less focused on Kant but also relevant are various of the papers reprinted in <a href="#Crisp and Slote"><strong>Crisp and Slote</strong></a>. See especially Michael Stocker’s ‘The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories’ and Susan Wolf’s ‘Moral Saints’—the latter is also reprinted in <a href="#Cahn and Markie"><b>Cahn and Markie</b></a>, <a href="#Shafer-Landau"><b>Shafer-Landau</b></a>, and <a href="#Sher"><b>Sher</b></a>. See also another paper in <a href="#Crisp and Slote"><strong>Crisp and Slote</strong></a>, Foot’s ‘Virtues and Vices,’ offering a <a href="#virtue_ethics"><strong>VIRTUE ETHICS</strong></a> perspective on issues of moral worth. For more on how this week’s topic connects with Kant’s wider aims in the <em>Groundwork</em> and later weeks’ topics, Korsgaard (1989) is very useful, as is Kerstein’s piece in <a href="Hill"><b>Hill</b></a>. You might also want to look at other ethical writings by Kant, especially the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> (1788) and the <em>Metaphysics of Morals</em> (1797), which are collected along with many other relevant writings in Kant (1997). Lastly, Rawls’ lectures on Kant, published in his (2000) are invaluable. The resurgence of interest in Kant’s ethics in the 70s and 80s was largely due to the influence of Rawls and his students, Barbara Herman, Christine Korsgaard, and Onora O’Neill, and his lectures are very helpful, both as a guide to <em>Groundwork</em> and in gaining a better understanding of Rawls’ influence on contemporary ethics. The first lecture on Kant is the one that is most relevant for this week, and lectures II to IV for next week.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-3">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In thinking about this topic in more depth focus first on the formulas of universal law (FUL) and universal law of nature (FLN). Influenced by Rawls and O’Neill, many take these to summarise a decision procedure for determining whether or not an action is permissible, the so-called <em>CI procedure</em>, which involves identifying the maxim of an action, “universalizing” it, and testing to see whether the result gives rise to either a <em>contradiction in conception</em> or a <em>contradiction in the will</em>. So understood, the central question is whether there is any interpretation of the procedure that avoids counter-examples—either false positives (intuitively immoral maxims that pass the tests) or false negatives (intuitively permissible maxims that fail). In thinking about the issue, work through the fairly exhaustive (and somewhat exhausting) catalogue of interpretations and counter-examples in Ch. 12 of Parfit (2011a), listed as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#deontology"><strong>THE PARADOX of DEONTOLOGY</strong></a>. See also: Wiggins (1987); Ch. 5 of O’Neill (1989); Nyholm (2015) and Kleingeld (2019), responding to Parfit; and Ch. 7 of Herman (1993). Galvin’s piece in <a href="#Hill"><strong>Hill</strong></a> is a good overview. The essay question focuses on the FUL and FLN, but think also about Kant’s other formulations of the CI. Past papers often include questions relating to the formula of humanity (FH), which enjoins us to use humanity in ourselves and others always as an end in itself and never merely as a means. Is there any way of understanding the distinction here between using humanity as an end in itself and never merely as a means so that it has moral significance? Parfit (2011a) is again very useful, criticising a range of different interpretations of the FH in Ch. 9. See also: Ch. 2 of Hill (1992); Ch. 6 of O’Neill (1989) and Ch. 4 of Korsgaard (1996), defending a possible consent approach; Pallikkathayil (2010), criticising the possible consent approach and connecting the FH to Kant’s political philosophy; Scanlon (2008); and Ch. 4 of Wood (1999), arguing that the FH only yields conclusions about duties on the basis of intermediate premises and a faculty of judgement irreducible to general rules—part of his campaign against treating Kant’s ethics as a kind of “ethical sausage machine”. Kerstein (2019) is a good survey of the issues, as is Dean’s contribution to <a href="#Hill"><strong>Hill</strong></a>. Lastly, have a think about the formulas of autonomy (FA) and the kingdom of ends (FKE). You’ll find relevant discussion of these in Ch. 3 of Hill (1992), Ch. 5 of Korsgaard (1996), Ch. 7 of O’Neill (1989), and Ch. 5 of Wood (1999)—while Holtmann’s contribution to <a href="#Hill"><strong>Hill</strong></a> provides an accessible overview. You’ll also find discussion of all the formulas in the lectures on Kant in Rawls (2000), listed as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="kant_1"><strong>KANT on MORAL MOTIVATION</strong></a>. See especially lectures II to IV.</p>

Nicely sets out the case for thinking of moral principles as derivable from the FUL in Ch. 5, emphasising importance of various principles of rational intending. But not all that helpful in thinking about problem cases. Also, no discussion of why we should think consistency to be of any moral significance, other than the fact that they're intuitively OK.

<p>Is there a way to interpret the principle that one ought never to treat anyone as a mere means that gives it non-derivative moral force and has intuitively compelling implications? (2021)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) ‘If lying to a bank employee in order to secure a loan which I cannot pay back cannot serve as a law of nature, lying to my captor in order to secure my freedom from imprisonment also cannot. Yet while the former is impermissible, the latter is permissible. So, whether something can hold as a universal law of nature is neither here nor there when it comes to its deontological status.’ Is this a good argument?<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
(b) What is the difference between treating someone as a means and treating them as a mere means? Does that difference matter, morally speaking? (2020)</p>

<p>What does it mean to treat humanity always as an end in itself and never as a mere means? Is this a plausible moral requirement? (2019)</p>

<p>So far we’ve been looking at the <em>content</em> of morality.

<!--
Ch. 1 and 2 are a great introduction to the significance of the issue.

The problem: if rational egoism is true then (a) one doesn't have any reason to be moral when it doesn't coincide with one's self-interest. And even when it **does**, (b) one's reason for being moral isn't the RIGHT reason; rather, one's reason is rather that it is in one's self-interest. So if rational egoism is true, morality doesn't have RATIONAL AUTHORITY.

Also Ch. 5 (on the ambitious vindications of Nagel, Korsgaard, Allison, and Parfit) and 11 (her own modest vindication).

<h4 id="further-reading-4">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>The problem posed by rational egoism goes back at least as far as Plato’s <em>Republic</em> (c. 380 BC). (You’ll find relevant extracts in <a href="#Cahn and Markie"><strong>Cahn and Markie</strong></a>, <a href="#Shafer-Landau"><strong>Shafer-Landau</strong></a>, and <a href="#Sher"><strong>Sher</strong></a>.) At first pass, the worry is that, if rational egoism is true, and one only ever has reason to pursue one’s self-interest, then one doesn’t have reason to be moral unless it advances one’s self-interest. Some respond by arguing that morality does advance one’s self-interest, i.e. by arguing for some form of ethical egoism. For one strategy here, see Ch. 13 to 15 of Hobbes’ <em>Leviathan</em>, reprinted in <a href="#Cahn and Markie"><strong>Cahn and Markie</strong></a>, <a href="#Raphael"><strong>Raphael</strong></a>, <a href="#Shafer-Landau"><strong>Shafer-Landau</strong></a>, and <a href="#Sher"><strong>Sher</strong></a>. For another, see the rest of Plato’s <em>Republic</em> and discussions of perfectionism in connection with <a href="#well-being"><strong>WELL-BEING</strong></a>. But it’s not clear that any form of ethical egoism fully addresses the problem. As Prichard (1912) emphasises, if rational egoism is true, one’s reason for being moral can only be that it is in one’s self-interest, and so doesn’t seem to be of the right sort—one cannot do the right thing <em>for the right reasons</em>. It may be that the better option is therefore to reject rational egoism altogether. There are various strategies here. One, associated particularly with proponents of Humean conceptions of practical rationality, rejects rational egoism for an alternative account on which some of us, some of the time, have reason to be moral, even when it goes against our self-interest—though others conceivably might not. Foot (1972) is a classic example, as is the piece by Williams in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>. Others take a harder line, and try to show that all of us, all of the time, have reason to be moral—i.e. to provide a <em>vindication</em> of morality. (The likes of Raz (1999), who thinks that there is something suspect about the idea of an amoralist, are harder to place.) Hills, in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, criticises various attempts to provide an <em>ambitious</em> vindication—i.e. one that would convince even the amoralist—and goes on to offer her own <em>modest</em> vindication. Think about the ambitious vindications she criticises, especially Parfit (1984). You’ll find more discussion of Parfit in the pieces by Brink and Johnston in Dancy, ed. (1997). Rounding off your work on Kant, you might also want to think about his attempt at ambitious vindication. See section III of the <em>Groundwork</em> as well as the discussion in Allison (2011) and Ch. 6 of Korsgaard (1996), listed as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for <a href="#kant_2"><strong>THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE</strong></a>. For a recent attempt at ambitious vindication, see de Lazari-Radek and Singer (2014). Think also about Hills’ own modest vindication, which is usefully contrasted with Prichard (1912). Psychological egoism also poses problems. Insofar as <em>ought</em> implies <em>can</em>, it appears to imply rational egoism, or something much like it. But it also seems to imply, more directly, that, even where one can do the right thing, one cannot do it for the right reasons. In thinking about it more, see, in addition to Blackburn’s piece in the <strong>CORE READING</strong>, Sober’s contribution to <a href="#LaFollette and Persson"><strong>LaFollette and Persson</strong></a> and Stich, Doris, and Roedder (2010). Also take a look at the early modern debate, especially Butler’s argument against psychological egoism in Sermon XI of his (1726) <em>Fifteen Sermons at the Rolls Chapel</em>, reprinted in <a href="#Cahn and Markie"><strong>Cahn and Markie</strong></a> and <a href="#Raphael"><strong>Raphael</strong></a>. For an important later treatment, key background to contemporary debates, see Sidgwick (1907), who hoped to show that rational egoism and morality, specifically utilitarianism, can be reconciled, but couldn’t see how to do it without appeal to God.</p>

Kantian approach, criticised by Hills: 

	Allison (1990), Ch. 12
	Hill, Jr. ‘Kant's Argument for the Rationality of Moral Conduct’

	Cambridge adds:
	
	Korsgaard, Ch. 6
	Tamar Schapiro (2001) Three Conceptions of Action in Moral Theory

Main problem: we are free only if we act rationally, so if we act irrationally, we're not free. But Kant thinks immoral action is irrational, so not free. But then immoral action is not action for which we're morally responsible!

A later solution, drawing on *Religion* and *MM*: distinguish the will, which is not properly regarded as free or unfree, from the power of choice, within which freedom resides. To act rationally is to act in accordance with the will. But one can choose whether or not to do so, exercising a free power of choice.

Kant's argument FOR his view of free will changes, appealing in CPrR to the fact of choice. Rawls goes into this at some length.

On this: Hume thinks not. Parfit thinks so: future Tuesday indifference. Some (brief) discussion in Brian Hedden's introduction to Part II of Andrea Sauchelli, ed. Parfit's Reasons and Persons (Routledge 2017). In a note, (n. 2 on p. 44) Hedden says: "See Street (2009) for critical discussion of all these ‘ideally coherent eccentrics.’ See also Broome (1991) for another prominent argument againt Humeanism about preference. Broome argues that some substantive constraints on preferences are required if the formal constraints of transitivity and the like are to have any bite. For criticism of Broome’s argument, see Dreier (1996)." The references are:

‘\[I\]n all ingenuous natures, the antipathy to treachery and roguery is too strong to be counter-balanced by any views of profit or pecuniary advantage.

<p>In pursuing this topic further, you might want to look at the rest of Books II and, especially, III of the <em>Treatise</em>, and will certainly want to look at the rest of the <em>Enquiry</em>, where Hume presents things a bit differently, foregrounding his positive account of virtue and vice, and relegating his case against moral rationalism to an appendix—Appendix 1. It also criticises egoism—see especially Appendix 2. And Hume himself thought it was “incomparably the best” of his writings. (<a href="Cahn and Markie"><b>Cahn and Markie</b></a> and <a href="Raphael"><b>Raphael</b></a> both reprint large parts of it.) Hume (1757), a later essay, is also very helpful. The main issues to think about are (a) Hume’s account of motivation and criticisms of moral rationalism, (b) his sentimentalist account of moral assessment, and (c) his account of the artificial virtues, especially justice. It’s mainly the first issue that comes up in past papers, but the others do come up on occasion. (Note that, while the examination regulations for the paper state that candidates will be given the opportunity to demonstrate first-hand knowledge of Hume’s writings, that doesn’t mean there will be questions <em>explicitly</em> about him, never mind his account of motivation or criticisms of rationalism!) In any case, all these aspects of Hume’s views are relevant to the issues we’re exploring this term, as well as various of other topics in ethics. In thinking about them, you’ll want to look at some of the secondary literature. Start with the papers by Penelhum and Norton in Norton and Taylor, eds. (2009)—the papers there by Taylor and Haakonsen are also useful. You’ll find similarly useful survey pieces in Parts III of both Radcliffe, ed. (2008) and Russell, ed. (2016). Beyond these, Mackie (1980) is a classic, and very influential, as is Stroud (1977). See also the lectures on Hume in Rawls (2000), listed in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="kant_1"><strong>KANT on MORAL MOTIVATION</strong></a>, as well as Baillie (2000), a more recent book-length treatment of Hume’s ethics, aimed at advanced undergraduates, and Cohon (2008), arguing against the standard interpretations of Hume as anticipating various views in contemporary metaethics—interpretations like Mackie’s. You can explore the connection between Hume and contemporary metaethics more in looking at <a href="#non-cognitivism"><strong>NON-COGNITIVISM and QUASI-REALISM</strong></a>, <a href="#motivational_internalism"><strong>MOTIVATIONAL INTERNALISM</strong></a>, and, especially, <a href="#reasoning"><strong>PRACTICAL REASONING</strong></a>. See also the papers by Radcliffe, Beauchamp, and Sturgeon in Part VI of Radcliffe, ed. (2008), and Railton’s paper in <a href="#Copp"><strong>Copp</strong></a>. For discussion of Hume on justice, see Ch. 10 of Darwall (1995), a great book on the early modern debate about moral obligation. Lastly, if you’re thinking about the differences between Hume and Kant, Korsgaard’s (1989) paper, ‘Kant’s Analysis of Obligation: The Argument of <em>Foundations</em> I,’ listed as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#kant_1"><strong>KANT on MORAL MOTIVATION</strong></a>, is a must-read.

<p><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>

<p>This week we return to the contemporary scene to look at virtue ethics. Drawing its inspiration from Aristotle, and emerging out of twentieth century criticism of consequentialism and deontology, it promises an interesting alternative to both. We’ll examine whether it can deliver on this promise.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-6">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>If you are planning on working on virtue ethics in more depth, <a href="#Crisp and Slote"><strong>Crisp and Slote</strong></a> is invaluable, collecting together various influential classics. Besides the Anscombe, see especially McIntyre’s ‘The Nature of the Virtues’, McDowell’s ‘Virtue and Reason’, and Foot’s ‘Virtues and Vices’, though Williams’ ‘Morality, the Peculiar Institution’, Stocker’s ‘The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories’, Wolf’s ‘Moral Saints’ (reprinted in <a href="#Cahn and Markie"><strong>Cahn and Markie</strong></a>, <a href="#Shafer-Landau"><strong>Shafer-Landau</strong></a>, and <a href="#Sher"><strong>Sher</strong></a>), and Murdoch’s ‘The Sovereignty of the Good over Other Concepts’ are also influential classics from the 70s and early 80s, and very much worth reading. Much of this early work is broadly Aristotelian in outlook—Murdoch’s more Platonic approach is a rare exception—and Aristotle’s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> is essential reading, regardless of whether you plan on working on the topic in any depth, really. (Relevant extracts are reprinted in <a href="#Cahn and Markie"><strong>Cahn and Markie</strong></a>, <a href="#Shafer-Landau"><strong>Shafer-Landau</strong></a>, and <a href="#Sher"><strong>Sher</strong></a>.) More recent work has developed alternative ways of thinking about virtue ethics. See, for example, the agent-based approach—influenced by Hume and other early modern sentimentalists—of Slote in his piece, ‘Agent-Based Virtue Ethics,’ in <a href="#Crisp and Slote"><strong>Crisp and Slote</strong></a> (and reprinted in <a href="#Shafer-Landau"><strong>Shafer-Landau</strong></a>,) and the pluralistic, target-centred approach presented in Swanton (2003). Many early virtue ethicists attacked the idea that moral deliberation could be understood in terms of a codifiable decision procedure—a theme that is especially prominent in McDowell and Williams, but which gave rise to the objection that virtue ethics is not action-guiding. Relatedly, it is objected that virtue ethics does not provide an adequate account of right action, failing either to correctly identify which acts are right in the first place, or to provide an adequate explanation of what makes them right. (Also related is the objection that virtue ethics entails a problematic <a href="#relativism"><strong>MORAL RELATIVISM</strong></a>.) See Johnson (2003) and, for a reply, see Annas (2004). See also Brewer (2009), insisting such objections rest on an assumption about right, wrong, and obligation that the original virtue ethicists—especially Anscombe—were concerned to reject. Other objections to think about include the worry that virtue ethics is problematically self-effacing—see Keller (2007)—or egoistic—see Annas (2007). For some discussion of <a href="#deontology"><strong>THE PARADOX of DEONTOLOGY</strong></a> relating to the latter worry, see LeBar (2009). Think also about the <em>justification problem</em>, how to justify claims about which traits are virtues, and the sceptical threat posed by results in social psychology that seem to show that there is no such thing as character traits, and so as virtues—the so-called <em>situationist critique</em>. The latter objection is pressed by Harman (1999), among others. For a reply to it, try Kamtekar (2004). You’ll also find good overviews of virtue ethics by Annas and Slote in <a href="#Copp"><strong>Copp</strong></a> and <a href="#LaFollette and Persson"><strong>LaFollette and Persson</strong></a> respectively, and a debate between Hursthouse and Driver about its prospects in <a href="#Dreier"><strong>Dreier</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Scanlon first presented his contractualism in a (1982) paper, written whilst visiting Oxford. He continued a long and fruitful debate with Parfit, who was sympathetic to the position but argued we’d do better to drop aspects of Scanlon’s version of it. See, in addition to Parfit (2003), Scanlon’s reply in the same issue of <em>Ratio</em>, which is a special issue devoted to <em>What We Owe To Each Other</em> and reprinted as Stratton-Lake, ed. (2004). See also Ch. 15 and 17 of Parfit (2011a), listed above as <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#deontology"><strong>THE PARADOX of DEONTOLOGY</strong></a>, in which he defends a variant form of contractualism (which he thinks coincides with both a kind of consequentialism and a kind of Kantianism). Then see Scanlon’s reply to the arguments of Parfit (2011a), ‘How I Am Not a Kantian,’ in Parfit (2011b), as well as Parfit’s own Ch. 21, 22, and 23. The latest instalments of the debate are in Stepanians and Frauchiger, eds. (2021), which includes Scanlon’s latest formulation of his views, ‘Contractualism and Justification,’ a critical paper by Parfit—sadly his last on the topic, delivered a few months before he died—and a reply from Scanlon. One of the main issues concerns the place of aggregation in contractualism. Recent work often focuses on the problems posed by cases involving risk. See Frick (2015), defending an <em>ex ante</em> solution. A related issue concerns demandingness. See Ashford (2003) and, for a reply discussing contractualism’s implications for non-human animals, Hills (2010). For work on contractualism and deontology, see Brand-Ballard (2004), and pp. 470-4 of Kamm (2007), listed as <strong>CORE READING</strong> for <a href="#deontology"><strong>THE PARADOX of DEONTOLOGY</strong></a>. For more on the contractualist account of why we should be moral, see Scanlon (2008), esp. Ch. 4, listed in the <strong>FURTHER READING</strong> for <a href="#Kant_2"><strong>THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE</strong></a>. Also relevant here is Lenman (2006). Lastly, for discussion of so-called redundancy objections to contractualism, see Southwood (2010).</p>

#### FURTHER READING

This topic serves as an introduction to metaethics in general, but also to moral realism specifically. It focuses, somewhat artificially, on certain, historically important and otherwise central problems for moral realism. If you are studying the topic in depth, and want to get a good understanding of the range of solutions that moral realists have developed, you should also look at the entry for [**MORAL REALISM: PROSPECTS**](#moral_realism_2). First and foremost, there is a problem that emerges out of Moore's open question argument: what that argument seems to show is that moral facts and properties must be non-natural, but, as Mackie and Smith, in different ways, try to show, such non-natural facts and properties are problematic. Ch. 2 and 3 of Miller (2013) provide a good initial overview. Second, there's the problem of disagreement, and Mackie's argument from relativity. McGrath (2008) is a relatively recent discussion. For more on Mackie more generally, including his argument(s) from queerness, you should consult the entry for [**ERROR THEORY and FICTIONALISM**](#error_theory). Third, there's the problem of explanation. Harman's discussion of this prompted a lively debate with the so-called *Cornell realists*, and Nicholas Sturgeon in particular. See Sturgeon's contribution to Dreier, ed. (2006), as well as Nick Zangwill's reply. For a non-naturalist reply to Harman's challenge, try Scanlon (2014). A fourth problem relates to the fact that our moral thinking has been influenced by evolutionary processes. Street (2006) is a classic on this. For some critical discussion, try Fitzpatrick (2015). Lastly, have a think about how best to characterise moral realism, and what James Dreier (2004) calls the problem of creeping minimalism.

<!-- NOTES on CORE READING

FLETCHER
Very nice, clear, accessible discussion of the main approaches, summarising main arguments for and against. Invaluable for quick overview.

PARFIT 
Famously distinguishes hedonistic, desire-fulfillment, and objective list theories; criticises hedonistic and, esp. desire-fulfillment theories; opts for an objective list theory with subjective components.

GRIFFIN
Offers a theory on which the substantial component is an objective list theory (Ch. 3 and 4), but the (more interesting) explanatory component is an informed desire-fulfillment theory (Ch. 1 and 2).

CRISP
Fairly straightforward defence of hedonism, discussing (a) the objection that the things we enjoy don't share any common quality of enjoyableness (he thinks they do), (b) the doctrine of swine objection (he defends something like Mill's higher-lower pleasure response), and (c) the experience machine objection (he grants the intuition, but tries to explain it away). No reason not to set this as Core Reading, really.

---

Griffin offers a theory on which the substantial component is an objective list theory (Ch. 3 and 4), but the more interesting explanatory component is an informed desire-fulfillment theory (Ch. 1 and 2). He summarises: 

	“The advantages of the informed desire account, therefore, seem to me to be these. It provides the materials needed to encompass the complexity of prudential value. It has the advantages of scope and flexibility over explanations of ‘well-being‘ in terms of desirability features. It has scope, because all prudential values, from objects of simple varying tastes to objects of universal informed agreement, register somewhere in informed preferences. It has flexibility, because not everyone's well-being is affected in the same way by a certain desirability feature, and we want a notion sensitive to these individual differences. We want to know not only that something is valuable, but how valuable it is, and how valuable to different persons.” (pp. 30-1)

How does he get there? First, he criticises mental-state accounts, such as hedonism. He offers two objections to these. (1) There's the example of Freud and his terminal illness, designed to illustrate the idea that there's no single positive feeling such that more of it makes us better off, and no single negative one such that more of it makes us worse off. (2) Against more complex, Mill-type views, that could accommodate the case of Freud by saying it's not that there's a common sensation to all pleasures, but rather a common attitude towards them, there's the objection that the attitude is not towards mental states, offering something like the experience machine objection. We prefer the bitter truth to comforting delusion. 

But I don't think the issues are so clear. It's true we *prefer* the bitter truth. But is it (prudentially) better for us to have it? (The same issue arises in the case of the experience machine objection.) Sumner raises this objection in his piece on WB in Crisp and Hooker, eds. (2000), but goes on to reject it:

	“If what you have treasured as an important ingredient of your well-being&mdash;your accomplishments, say, or your deep personal relations&mdash;turns out to have been an elaborate deception, you are likely to feel hurt and betrayed. How else to explain this, except to say that, at least in this area of your life, what mattered to you was not merely how things seemed but how they actually were? Your reaction to the deception certainly looks, and feels, like a reassessment, in the light of your own priorities, of how well your life has been going for you. And that seems to place it squarely within the domain of prudential value.” (p. 6).
	
Is there no scope for saying, yes, it mattered to you, but it didn't affect how well your life went? (So long as you were deceived, at any rate: of course, the *discovery* of the deception brought about negative changes.)

Later chapters (esp. Ch. 6 and 7) are also relevant, especially to questions about inter- and intrapersonal comparison. Sugden's review: 

	“If I am to make an impartial comparison between two lives, I must strip myself of my own tastes and imagine myself first as one person, with his tastes, and then as the other, with hers. But then how can there be a me that prefers being him to being her? Griffin's conclusion is that interpersonal judgments cannot rest on values that are personal to the judge: they must rest on universal values.” 

Which sounds to me like an affirmation of a consequent.

READ. Nice, but very introductory overview, discussing Moore and Scanlon, as well as three main approaches. Worth setting if also setting Scanlon or Moore; otherwise, Fletcher is more comprehensive 



#### FURTHER READING

You'll most likely have looked at this topic in first year, looking at hedonism&mdash;both whether it is consistent with Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures and whether it's refuted by Nozick's experience machine objection&mdash;and desire-fulfillment and objective list theories of well-being. (If not, ask me for the first year essay question and reading list, and do that instead.)

The first three chapters of Fletcher (2016), which is an excellent and very accessible treatment of this week's topic more generally, provide a good refresher. See also three classics of the mid-80s: Parfit (1986), defending an objective-list theory, Railton (1986), defending a desire-fulfillment theory, and Griffin (1986), defending a desire-fulfillment theory of prudential well-being, and a narrower objective-list theory of the notion of well-being appropriate to moral theory. 

For a refresher on these and other topics, see the first three chapters of Fletcher (2016), an excellent and accessible textbook on this week's topic more generally. See also Crisp (2006) and Feldman (2002), defending hedonism, Railton (1986) and Rosati (1996) defending desire-fulfillment theories, and Griffin (1988) and Parfit (1986) defending objective list theories.

#### FURTHER READING

The further literature on this week's topic is vast. With that, however, there is also a lot of good introductory literature. Gary Watson's 'Introduction' to **Watson** is very helpful, offering a great overview of the issues, and you'll find several useful entries in the *Stanford Encyclopedia*; the Related Entries section at the bottom of McKenna and Coates (2004/15), listed above, provides links. If you want a good book on the topic, aimed at advanced undergraduates, try McKenna and Pereboom (2016). In pursuing the topic in depth, you'll want to think a bit more about van Inwagen's consequence argument. The main thing to look at here is Lewis (1981). You'll also want to think a bit more about Frankfurt's challenge to the Principle of Alternate Possibilities and Peter Strawson's account of moral responsibility in terms of reactive attitudes. To that end, Widerker and McKenna (2006) and McKenna and Russell (2008) are useful collections of articles, the former focused on Frankfurt and the latter on Strawson. But the main thing to do is familiarise yourself with contemporary libertarian, compatibilist, and sceptical approaches to free will and moral responsibility. See, in the first place, Chisholm (1964), Frankfurt (1971), Wolf (1987), and Strawson (1994). Then go on and look at the other papers in <b>Watson</b>, using the introductory literature above as your guide.

<p>‘We hold parents responsible for the behaviour of their children and leaders responsible for the behaviour of their followers. So we have no problem in principle with holding people responsible for what they do not control. Determinism is therefore no threat to the possibility of moral responsibility.’ Is this argument sound? (2021)</p>

<p>‘What matters for determining moral responsibility is why she did what she did, not whether she could have done something else.’ Is that right? (2020)</p>

<p>‘If a neuroscientist implanted electrodes in my brain and thereby induced in me attitudes that deterministically led me to wholeheartedly perform a certain crime, then she, and not I, would be morally responsible for the crime.’ Do you agree? What does your answer imply about the plausibility of compatibilism? (2019)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) ‘The freedom discovered in reflection is not a theoretical property which can also be seen by scientists considering the agent’s deliberations third-personally and from outside. It is from within the deliberative perspective that we see our desires as providing suggestions which we may take or leave.’ (KORSGAARD) Discuss.<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
(b) ‘Arguments for compatibilism based on Frankfurt-style cases face a dilemma. If the inevitability of the agent’s action given the “prior sign” is grounded in causal determinism, then the question is begged against the incompatibilist. But if we eliminate the causal determination then the agent has robust alternative possibilities after all.’ Discuss. (2018)</p>
