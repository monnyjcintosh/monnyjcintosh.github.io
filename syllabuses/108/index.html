<h1 id="philosophy-of-logic-and-language">Philosophy of Logic and Language</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Logic and Language. Many of the readings are online, and easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/108%20Philosophy%20of%20Logic%20and%20Language.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. The first two weeks look at classic works by Frege and Russell, laying the foundations for the next two weeks, which look at issues concerning proper names, particularly as they emerge out of work by Kripke. The remaining four weeks are left open for topics of your choice. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve had advice from various friends and colleagues in putting together this reading list and its previous incarnations. I’m particularly grateful to Brian Ball, Nick Tasker, and various students over the years. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of this reading list at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<p><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>

<h4 id="essay-question">ESSAY QUESTION</h4>

<p>Why did Frege distinguish between sense and reference? Was he right to do so? If so, what is the sense of a proper name, such as ‘Hesperus’? If not, how is the informativeness of an identity statement, such as ‘Hesperus is Phosphorus’, to be explained?</p>

</div>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Other relevant writings by Frege include his (1918) paper, which is well worth reading in connection with <a href="#indexicals"><strong>INDEXICALS and DEMONSTRATIVES</strong></a> as well. Contemporary scholarship on Frege is dominated by Michael Dummett’s work, especially his magisterial (1981). Chapter 5 discusses the sense-reference distinction. Burge’s writings on Frege, collected in his (2005), are no less essential, and probably more sensitive to textual and historical considerations. Part II focuses on sense and cognitive value, though the best place to start is ‘Frege on Truth’, first published in 1986, in Part I. Michael Kremer’s contribution to the same volume as Taschek’s, above, is also very helpful, as are Heck and May (2008) and the rest of Textor (2011). McDowell (1977) is another piece of essential reading, articulating a non-descriptive Fregean approach, but it is quite hard going; it will be easier to understand the main idea after looking at Davidson’s proposal in the Core Reading for <a href="#meaning"><strong>MEANING</strong></a>. You might also want to look at the interpretation of Frege in Ch. 1 of Evans (1982), which offers a similar approach to McDowell’s. For more on the debate between Millians (or neo-Russellians) and Fregeans, see Caplan (2007) and Fodor (2008). For an introduction to <em>relationism</em>, a new approach developed by Kit Fine, see Gray (2017).</p>

<h4 id="past-paper-questions">PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</h4>

<p>NOTE: I’ve included questions from the <em>Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein</em> paper, which is discontinued. As I understand it, questions on Frege’s and Russell’s work in the philosophy of logic and language, which used to be set for that paper, will now be set for this paper instead—though I haven’t seen any yet.</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong>   <br />
(a) The name ‘Madagascar’ was originally used to refer to a portion of the African mainland but was then applied to its current bearer (the island) in error. Are cases like this fatal to Kripke’s ‘causal chain’ theory of the reference of proper names?<br />
<strong>OR</strong>   <br />
(b) ‘Kripke’s arguments against descriptivism show that names do not have sense as well as reference.’ Do you agree? (2018)</p>

<p>Do names have sense (Sinn) as well as reference (Bedeutung)? (2016, Paper 117)</p>

<p>To what extent do Frege’s reasons for ascribing sense and reference to proper names generalize to ascribing sense and reference to sentences? (2015, Paper 117)</p>

<p>‘Whilst it is plausible to suppose that words have a reference, and sentences a sense, it is not nearly so plausible to suppose that words have a sense and sentences a reference.’ Discuss, with reference to ONE or MORE of Frege, Russell, and the Tractatus. (2014, Paper 117)</p>

<p>Kripke (1977) is a must-read, defending Russell in response to the problems raised by Donnellan. Neale (1990) is an influential exposition and defence of Kripke’s position. See also Recanati (1993), offering a <em>contextualist</em> account of Donnellan’s examples, and Michael Devitt’s contribution to Reimer and Bezuidenhout, eds. (2004), offering an <em>ambiguity</em> account. See also Zacharska (2010), criticising the ambiguity account, and defending the contextualist one. While Russell’s position was for a long time the orthodox position—thanks in large part to Neale (1990)—Strawson’s has made a come back in recent years. Kai von Fintel’s paper in Reimer and Bezuidenhout, eds. (2004) is important here. See also Yablo (2006) and Elbourne (2013). (Paul Elbourne is often an examiner for this paper, so it is a good idea to gain some familiarity with his views!) For more on the problem of incomplete descriptions, raised by Strawson, see Reimer (1998)<!-- and the Core Readings for the topic, [**QUANTIFIER DOMAIN RESTRICTION**](#qdr)-->.

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Kripke offers arguments against descriptivist answers to both the <em>semantic</em> question of what, if anything, the meaning of a proper name is and the <em>metasemantic</em> question of how its referent is fixed—arguments known as his modal, epistemological, and semantic arguments. The two main lines of response to the modal argument are wide scope strategy, pursued in Dummett (1981), and the actualised description strategy, pursued in Searle (1983). Soames criticises these in the Core Reading, but see Sosa (2002) for a reply on behalf of wide scope strategy. For more on the epistemological argument, see Jeshion (2002). Think also about what other answers we might give to the semantic and metasemantic questions. Some, like Katz (2001), think Kripke’s arguments leave untouched a non-Fregean descriptivism. See also Graff Fara (2015), defending the view that names are predicates. Others think they leave untouched a non-descriptivist Fregeanism. McDowell (1977), mentioned in the Further Reading for <a href="#frege"><strong>SENSE and REFERENCE</strong></a> is the <em>locus classicus</em> for this sort of view, but perhaps better in the first instance to look at Sainsbury (2005), listed in next week’s Further Reading, which is a great guide to many of the issues we’ve been looking at. Kripke himself seems inclined, albeit tentatively, to Millianism, the view defended by Soames in the rest of his (2002) as well as by Salmon (1986) in the Core Reading for <a href="#frege"><strong>SENSE and REFERENCE</strong></a>, as an answer to the semantic question, and the causal theory of reference as an answer to the metasemantic question. For more on the causal theory of reference and metasemantics, see Dickie (2011), and §3 of Speaks (2010/19) for an overview of the broader issues. And see Cumming (2008/19) for an excellent overview of work on the semantics of names. Lastly, think about the puzzles that motivated descriptivism in the first place. You’ll look at puzzles surrounding <a href="#empty_names"><strong>EMPTY NAMES</strong></a> next week. You might also want to look at those concerning <a href="#propositional_attitude_reports"><strong>PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDE REPORTS</strong></a> in a later week.</p>

<p>Kripke (2013) is the published version of his John Locke lectures, delivered in Oxford in 1973, and which circulated in manuscript form in the intervening period. They set out an influential, broadly Millian approach to the problems of apparently empty names, but there are other Millian approaches out there, and if you are pursuing the topic in more depth, you should start by working through the details of some of these. Try, in particular, Salmon (1998) and Braun (2005). One of Kripke’s proposals is that fictional names, like ‘Sherlock Holmes’, refer to abstract objects of a certain sort. This is taken up by both Salmon and Braun, and also by Amie Thomasson, who has perhaps explored the idea in most detail. See, for example, her (2003). Have a think, also, about some alternative approaches to fictional names. Lewis (1978) offers a possibilist account, making use of his infamous modal realism. This is usefully contrasted with the perhaps even more radical position of Meinongians, like Parsons (1982). Kroon and Voltolini (2018) is a good overview of the issues hereabouts. Sainsbury develops his views about empty names in more detail in his (2005) book, which is strongly recommended. See especially the first chapter, which offers a concise history of work on names, deftly summarising issues and debates we’ve been looking at throughout the term so far. Sainsbury’s approach, drawing on Burge (1974), employs a negative free logic. In thinking about it, have a look at Ray’s paper in García Carpintero and Martí, eds. (2014), which argues that the problems posed by (genuinely) empty names have a straightforward solution, superficially similar to Sainsbury’s, but making no use of free logic. Do you agree? Many of the other papers in García Carpintero and Martí, eds. (2014) are also very helpful.</p>

<p>The puzzle of invariant meaning goes back to Frege. See Perry (1977) on Frege’s treatment of the puzzle, arguing that it is inconsistent with certain aspects of his views about sense, and Evans (1985) for a reply.<!--See also Kripke (2011) on this, and Burge (2012), 'Living Wages of Sinn'. --> Kaplan’s solution to the puzzle emerged in the early 1970s out of earlier work by Richard Montague and the formal semantics tradition. He expands on his approach in his (1989b). For an alternative approach, emerging around about the same time out of the Davidsonian tradition you can look at in connection with <a href="#meaning"><strong>MEANING</strong></a>, see Burge (1974). You’re probably best to focus on the various problems that have been raised with Kaplan’s theory though. Cohen and Michaelson (2013) is an accessible survey piece on the so-called <em>answering machine paradox</em>, threatening Kaplan’s claim that ‘I am here now’ is a logical truth. Reimer (1991) and Bach (1992) debate the role of speakers’ intentions in determining the reference of a demonstrative. For further discussion of King’s approach to complex demonstratives, see his (2008) and the replies from Braun and Salmon in the same issue. <!--For alternatives to both Kaplan's and King's approaches, see Elbourne (2008) and Roberts (2002). --><!--You may also want to look at the Special Topic, [**ASSERTORIC CONTENT and INGREDIENT SENSE**](#assertoric_content), especially the papers by Lewis and King, which discuss Kaplan's identification of the contents of sentences with what they are used to say. -->Braun (2001/15) is a survey article on these and other issues concerning indexicals and demonstratives.</p>

#### FURTHER READING  

In working on this topic, make sure you have a good grasp of Foster's problem and of the various solutions that have been offered for it. Segal (1999) gives a very nice, concise explanation of the issue before going on to present a solution, though the main approaches to think about are probably those of John McDowell and Jim Higginbotham. McDowell's is found in his (1977) paper, listed under [**SENSE and REFERENCE**](#frege). Platts (1997) and Wiggins (1997) are very helpful guides to McDowell, but also to the Davidsonian program more generally, and are strongly recommended. Higginbotham's approach is set out in his (1992). For critical discussion of this, see Soames (2008), to which Lepore and Ludwig (2010) is a response. Other general problems with the project of explaining meaning in terms of truth include the worry, raised early on by Michael Dummett in his (1959), that it is incompatible with deflationism about truth. There are also problems, arguably more concerning details of implementation, relating to non-declarative sentences, whose meanings aren't obviously amenable to explanation in terms of truth-conditions, and context-sensitivity. There's some discussion of the former in McDowell (1977), and you can think about the latter in connection with the topics [**INDEXICALS and DEMONSTRATIVES**](#indexicals) and, especially, [**CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY**](#context-sensitivity). You'll also find relevant discussion in the two books I've listed by Lepore and Ludwig. Context-sensitivity is discussed in Ch. 5 of their (2005), and non-declaratives in Ch. 12 of their (2007). For other writings by Davidson on the general topic of truth and meaning, see the other papers in (2001) collection, starting with his 'Radical Interpretation', which will be of particular interest if you're thinking about metasemantics and the sort of large-scale issues we first looked at in connection with [**NAMING and NECESSITY**](#kripke).

#### PAST PAPER QUESTIONS  

‘Questions and imperatives have meaning but no truth conditions. So the meaning of a sentence cannot be its truth conditions.’ Is this a good argument? (2019)

Is the view that the meaning of a sentence is that sentence’s truth-conditions consistent with a deflationary theory of truth? (2015)  

Under what circumstances, if any, is a theory of truth an adequate theory of meaning? (2014)   

Explain and assess the thesis that meaning is given by truth-conditions. (2013)  

What problems are posed by non-indicative moods for a truth-conditions theory of meaning? Are they soluble? (2012)

<h4 id="further-reading-6">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in any depth, Pessin and Goldberg, eds. (1996) is extremely useful. The papers of most immediate relevance are those in Part II, focused on natural kinds and the philosophy of language—see especially the papers by Zemach, Mellor, and Searle. See also the papers by Burge in Part III, defending externalism about the contents of mental states, and Putnam’s introduction, which replies to Searle and Burge. Though it doesn’t tend to come up in exams, you might also want to think about Kripke’s approach to kind terms, rounding out your work on last week’s topic. See especially Lecture III of his <em>Naming and Necessity</em> and Ch. 9 to 11 of Soames (2002), listed in the Core Reading for <a href="#kripke"><strong>NAMING and NECESSITY</strong></a>. You’ll often find reference to the Kripke-Putnam account of kind terms, and there are certainly some commonalities, but don’t let such talk obscure the important differences between them in both theory and motivation. Hacking (2007) is excellent on this. See also Wikforss (2007), which carefully disentangles various externalist theses at stake in the debate, distinguishing Putnam’s claims from those of both Kripke and Burge. For some recent and sympathetic discussion of Chomsky, see Pietroski (2017). For discussion of Jackson, see Ch. 4 of Kallestrup (2012), which also discusses the two-dimensionalist approach of Chalmers (2002). Segal (2004) offers an internalist account of natural kind concepts, and disputes the relevance of intuitions cited in support of externalism. Lastly, see Yli-Vakurri (2018) for a recent attempt to establish semantic externalism without thought experiments, and Sawyer (2018) for a reply.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-7">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In working on this topic in more depth, start by making sure you’ve got a good grasp of Grice’s own views. To this end, the rest of his (1989) <em>Studies in the Way of Words</em> is essential, particularly the other papers in Part I, <em>Logic and Conversation</em>. See also Saul (2002), arguing that the standard picture of Grice is mistaken. You should also think about the relationship between the category of conversational implicature, on the one hand, and those of conventional implicatures and presuppositions, on the other. For a good introduction, and further references, see Potts (2015). See also Bach (1999), arguing that there is no such thing as conventional implicature<!--, and the reading suggested for [**PRESUPPOSITION**](#presupposition)-->. Otherwise, think about the various refinements, objections, and alternatives to Grice’s theory that have emerged over the years. Key here are the approaches of neo-Griceans, like Larry Horn and Stephen Levinson, and Relevance Theorists, like Deirdre Wilson, Dan Sperber, and Robyn Carston. For good introductions, see the papers by Horn and by Wilson and Sperber in Horn and Ward, eds. (2004). See also Ernie Lepore and Matthew Stone’s (2015) book, building on work by David Lewis on convention and discourse structure to argue that phenomena traditionally explained in terms of general purpose reasoning are to instead be explained in terms of speakers’ knowledge of language. Part I introduces the Gricean, neo-Gricean, and Relevance Theoretic approaches, which are critically discussed in the rest of the book. The wider context is a debate over the contribution linguistic meaning and grammar makes to what is said and the significance of utterances more generally—the so-called <em>semantics-pragmatics holy wars</em>. Important early contributions to this debate include Carston (1988) and Bach (1994). See also <a href="#context-sensitivity"><strong>CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY</strong></a>. Recent debate often focuses on <em>scalar implicatures</em>, particularly in embedded contexts. Though it’s something of a special topic, you may want to get a sense of what the debate here is about; Sauerland (2012) is a good place to start. Lastly, see Davis (2005/19) for a survey article on conversational implicature.</p>

#### FURTHER READING  

For more on Cappelen and Lepore's *semantic minimalism* (and speech act pluralism) see their (2005) book, and two symposiums on the book, one in <i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i> **72**(2) and the other in <i>Mind & Language</i> **21**(1). See also Borg (2004), who pursues a similar approach, appealing to some ideas in the philosophy of cognitive science. For *indexicalism*, see Szabó (2001) and the various papers collected in Stanley (2005)&mdash;the introduction is very helpful. See also the position defended in Rothschild and Segal (2009). Semantic minimalism and indexicalism are opposed by both Travis and so-called *contextualists*, like Robyn Carston and François Récanati. See Carston (2002) and Récanati (2004) respectively, the latter engaged, among other things, in a debate with Stanley over so-called unarticulated constituents, a debate which has been the focus of recent past paper questions. Other views to think about include the *nonindexical contextualism* of Predelli (2005), also explored by John Macfarlane, and the view that context-shifting arguments highlight shifts in the linguistic meaning of words like 'green', defended by Williamson in his (1999) paper.

<p>‘When A is true and B is false, “If A then B” is definitely false. Also, from “not-A or B” we can infer “If A then B”, which shows that whenever A is false or B is true, “If A then B” is true.

Kirkham (1992) is an accessible overview of various issues related to this week's topic. Field (1972) influentially argues that Tarski's theory aims (but fails) to provide a definition of truth that would acceptable to physicalists. McDowell (1978) is a response. Sher (1999) discusses both Field's and other challenges to Tarski. Heck (1997) discusses the connection between Tarskian definitions of truth taken as, roughly, theories specifying the meanings of the sentences of the object-language and as theories of what 'true' means in the metalanguage.

#### FURTHER READING  
The other papers in Part I of Reimer and Bezuidenhout (2004) offer different perspectives: Lepore defends a minimalist approach, Recanati a situation theoretic one. For more on situation theory, as well as its application to this issue, see Kratzer (2007/17). Stanley (2002) is in some ways a superior presentation of the Stanley and Szabó approach. More recent contributions to the debate include Arregui (2008) and Elbourne (2008). For a helpful overview of the recent debate, see von Fintel (2014) &mdash; the slides of a presentation given at a workshop at Rutgers.

#### PAST PAPER QUESTIONS

Could propositions be sets of truth-supporting circumstances? (2016)

‘If propositions are sets of possible worlds, then the proposition that 2+2=4 is identical to the proposition that water is H2O. But this is absurd; so propositions must have a sentence-like structure.’ Discuss. (2015)

## ASSERTORIC CONTENT AND INGREDIENT SENSE
[TOP](#top)

**ESSAY QUESTION**  
What is the relationship between the *ingredient sense* of a sentence, i.e. the contribution that it makes to the truth-conditions of sentences in which it occurs, and its *assertoric content*, i.e. what it can be used on its own to say or assert?

**CORE READING**  
There isn't a great deal of introductory stuff on this topic, but there is a short discussion in §3.2 of:

**FURTHER READING**  
Dummett first discussed the relationship between ingredient sense and assertoric content explicitly in his (1973) book, *Frege: Philosophy of Language*, though the roots go back to his (1959) article, 'Truth'. His (2004) is a concise, and fairly accessible discussion. Glanzberg (2011) is a nice, short piece on the issues surrounding the semantics of tense. Ninan (2012) is a response to King. Mackay (2013) argues for "monsters", or context-shifting operators. Stojnic (2017) is a nice recent paper on the topic, critically discussing an appeal Jason Stanley makes to the assertoric content-ingredient sense distinction.
