<h1 id="knowledge--reality">Knowledge &amp; Reality</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge &amp; Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have (generally) divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, with four weeks on topics in epistemology and three weeks on topics in metaphysics. I’ve left the last week open, so as to allow you to choose a topic yourself. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. (These are divided into topics in Epistemology, Metaphysics, and Self-Study, the latter being those you will most likely have looked at in first year for General Philosophy, and so might feel comfortable exploring on your own.)</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Knowledge &amp; Reality to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. I’m grateful to various friends and colleagues for advice and discussion of it, especially Alex Kaiserman, Brent Madison, and Nick Tasker. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of the list at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free.</p>

<p>While most of the readings can be obtained online, it’s often useful to have good anthologies and collections of papers in epistemology and metaphysics, so as to be able to read around a bit more widely. The following are all recommended, containing many key readings and more besides, and are referenced below:</p>

<p>There are no set textbooks, but it will be useful to have one or two to hand, for both preparation beforehand and consolidation afterwards. I recommend choosing from the following, depending on your focus:</p>

<p>Dancy (1986) and Lowe (2002) are obviously a little older than the others, but are classic introductions to epistemology and metaphysics, respectively.

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In exploring this topic in more depth, start with the relevant debates in <strong>ST&amp;S</strong>, which could easily have served as Core Reading. James Pryor’s contribution is particularly important: his <em>dogmatism</em> is, alongside Michael Huemer’s <em>phenomenal conservatism</em>, one of the main foundationalist developments of recent years. You can look at the issues surrounding it in more detail in doing <strong>SCEPTICISM</strong> or <strong>PERCEPTION</strong>. Greco and Sosa, eds. (1999) contains a couple of useful discussions. Williams’s ‘Skepticism’, defending a non-standard position that he calls <em>contextualism</em>—though this is not the same as view as the one we look at in doing the <a href="#contextualism"><strong>CONTEXTUALISM</strong></a> topic—and Bonjour’s ‘The Dialectic of Foundationalism and Coherentism’, which sets out the sorts of considerations that led him to abandon the coherentism of his (1985) for a form of foundationalism.</p>

<p>For an important problem facing both internalist and externalist forms of foundationalism—the problem of easy knowledge—see Cohen (2002). For more on infinitism, see the papers in Turri and Klein, eds. (2014). Other good introductions include the two <em>Stanford Encyclopedia</em> entries, Hasan and Fumerton (2000/16) and Olsson (2003/17), and Fumerton (2018).</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-1">FURTHER READING</h4>
<p>In working further on this topic, start by getting a good sense of what epistemic contextualism is. The best way to do this is to think about alternative views, including classical invariantism and subject-sensitive invariantism (SSI). Classical invariantism is defended in Brown (2006). SSI is defended by Hawthorne in the Core Reading. Think also about different ways in which contextualism can be developed. Lewis (1996) is important here. DeRose fleshes out his case for contextualism and replies to objections in his (2009). McKenna (2015) is a useful survey of recent work. The debate between contextualists and SSIs raises questions about the role of pragmatic factors, such as practical interests, in knowledge. Fantl and McGrath (2009) is a great discussion of this, and one of the best books in epistemology of the last wee while. Kim (2017) a survey of the recent debate. <b>ST&amp;S</b> is also useful here, containing accessible debates between Fantl and McGrath and Baron Reed over whether pragmatic factors affect knowledge, as well as Conee and Cohen over contextualism itself. The latter includes, among other things, discussion of whether contextualism provides a satisfactory response to the sceptic. See also DeRose (2017), developing his contextualist treatment of sceptical and lottery puzzles.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Our topic for this week and next is Tim Williamson’s knowledge-first epistemology, set out in his <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i>. This is the most influential book of the past 40 or so years in epistemology, and arguably in analytic philosophy more generally, so it is well worth studying in depth. (I’ve assumed you’re familiar from first year work in General Philosophy with the Gettier problem and various responses to it. If you’re not familiar with these, let me know before the start of term so that I can suggest a slightly different set of topics in epistemology.) In thinking about the main themes, you’d do well to look at some of the critical responses in Greenough and Pritchard, eds. (2009), together with Williamson’s replies. Particularly recommended are the pieces by Quassim Cassam and Elizabeth Fricker. See also the debate between Williamson and Trent Dougherty and Patrick Rysiew in <b>ST&amp;S</b>, Nagel (2013), Hyman (2014), and the papers in the Carter, Gordon, and Jarvis, eds. (2017)—especially the editors’ Introduction, and the papers by Smith and by Ichikawa and Jenkins. But perhaps the main thing to look at is Ch. 3 of <i>Knowledge and its Limits</i>, which, as Williamson says, deepens the critique of internalism. It’s usefully read in combination with Yablo (2003). McGlynn (2014) is a nice monograph on the topic, and will be usefully read in connection with whatever you choose to focus on next week too.</p>

<!--
Later thoughts on reading: Take the Sider as introductory, and set something else, non-reductive, as a third main piece.

In the further reading, list Loux, ed. And discuss the various issues that the major pieces in that talk about: trans-world identity, theories of actuality, actualism/possibilism debate. Then: recent approaches to modality. 

OR: go for Cameron's Phil Compass piece, which focuses on Lewis, Fine, and conventionalism. For the main Core, list Lewis, Fine, and Stalnaker. Keep Sider as Further Reading, listing also: Blackburn? (for an example of conventionalism of a sort), Vetter?, defence of modalism?, etc. Sider's Writing the Book for conventionalism (of a sort) too, maybe.

---

Thoughts on reading: The Melia's OK, but it'd be nice to find an overview of the debates. The earlier Lewis is easier, if it comes to it. Stalnaker's got a really comprehensive piece engaging with Lewis in Blackwell's Companion to Metaphysics. The Sider remains a good option. So too the Lycan, probably.

The rest of the Melia's fine, as are the debates in SH&Z and the Menzel.

Other stuff: keep the Rosen, maybe also Fine. I'm less sure about the rest.

I want something on modalism. More on reductionism would be good: Ch. 3 of Hale? Vetter tries to explain modality in terms of potentiality in Ch. 6 of her book. I want to read Kment, Ch. 2.

<h4 id="further-reading-3">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in more depth, the rest of Lewis (1986) is essential. The second chapter defends Lewis’s extreme realism from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. The fourth and final chapter defends counterpart theory, his alternative to the view that there are transworld identities. Loux, ed. (1979) is also very useful, collecting together various classic papers. Many of them defend what Vetter (2011) calls <em>classical actualism</em>, agreeing with Lewis that modality is to be explained in terms of possible worlds, but disagreeing with him in holding that possible worlds themselves may be explained in terms of actual entities—propositions (Adams), states of affairs (Plantinga), or properties (Stalnaker), for example. Sider (2003) is an accessible survey of some of the main issues, as is Melia (2003), an introduction for advanced undergraduates, discussing, among other things, Quinean scepticism about modality and <em>modalism</em>, the view that modality is to be understood, not in terms of quantification over possible worlds, but in terms of primitive modal operators, ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’. See also the debate in <strong>SH&amp;Z</strong> between Bricker, defending extreme realism, and Melia, defending actualism. Recent years have seen a proliferation of alternative approaches, and you’ll want to think about some of these too. Rosen (1990) defends <em>fictionalism</em>, the view that possible worlds are a useful fiction. Sider (2011) elaborates on the <em>quasi-conventionalism</em> that he sketches towards the end of his (2003) paper. Thomasson (2007) defends a form of <em>non-cognitivism</em> about modality—similar to the non-cognitivism you might already be familiar with from metaethics. Think also about the approaches of <em>new actualists</em>, who seek to explain modality in terms of actual entities, but without appeal to possible worlds. See Vetter (2011), discussing Fine’s <em>essentialist</em> approach as well as her own <em>dispositionalism</em>, for a discussion of some of the issues.</p>

Sider in **L&Z**.
If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the rest of Melia (2003) is very helpful, and the rest of Lewis (1986) essential: the second chapter defends Lewis's brand of modal realism from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views; the fourth and final chapter defends counterpart theory, his alternative to the view that there are transworld identities. Loux (1979) is also very helpful, containing a number of important papers on the issues, and a good introduction. Menzel (2013/16) is an accessible overview of the issues surrounding Lewis-style realism, abstractionism or ersatzism, and combinatorialism&mdash;the latter a view particularly associated with David Armstrong: see his (2004). <b>SH&Z</b> contains an accessible debate between Phillip Bricker and Joseph Melia, with Bricker defending concretism and Melia defending ersatzism. Also look at some alternative approaches. Rosen (1990) defends a fictionalist approach, while Melia (1992) is a critical discussion of modalism, the view, to a rough approximation, that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explained in terms of objects' essences. For an introduction to the issues surrounding *impossible* worlds, see Berto and Jago (2009/18).

Kripke (1980) is the source of his influential Humphrey objection to Lewis-style realism, and argues that the so-called problem of trans-world identity, pressed by Chisholm (1967) among others, is a pseudo-problem. 

For more on this issue, see Mackie and Jago's (2006/17) survey article for the <i>Stanford Encyclopedia</i>.

<p>For a general guide to the various issues in the philosophy of time, Dainton (2010) is hard to beat. If you’re working on the topic in more depth, I recommend you keep it to hand as you work through the main debates. Inspired by McTaggart, these are usually posed in terms of a distinction between A-theorists, like Prior, and B-theorists, like Mellor. Zimmerman, ed. (2004) contains some now-classic discussions of the main A-theory, <em>presentism</em>, while Prosser (2017) is a recent book-length defence of the B-theory, focused on explaining various aspects of our experience of time that seem to tell against the view. You’ll also find an accessible debate between Dean Zimmerman and Jack Smart in <b>SH&amp;Z</b>, with Zimmerman defending presentism and Smart defending the B-theory. Think also about other A-theories, however, particularly the so-called <em>growing block</em> and <em>moving spotlight</em> views. There is some relatively recent discussion of the former in Bennett and Zimmerman, eds. (2014); the latter has long been regarded the poor relation among A-theories, but see Cameron (2015) for a recent and influential attempt to revive it. In thinking more about McTaggart, start with Dummett (1960), an influential discussion and partial defence of the argument for the unreality of time. Then try Fine (2006), a fantastic paper, offering an interesting interpretation of Dummett’s position. Be warned, however: the Fine’s hard going—and the Dummett’s harder than it might initially seem. Lastly, to think more about issues in the philosophy of time, you might also think about <a href="#time_travel"><strong>TIME TRAVEL</strong></a>.</p>

<h4 id="further-reading-5">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>To at least a first approximation, the problem of change arises out of the fact that we understand persistence through change to be a matter of one and the same object having incompatible properties. Yet no object <em>can</em> have incompatible properties. Isn’t persistence through change, as we understand it, therefore impossible? Standard responses to the problem accept that no object can have incompatible properties, but insist that this can be reconciled with a correct understanding of persistence through change. Different theorists attempt the reconciliation in different ways, however, offering more or less revisionary accounts of persistence through change: perdurantists, like Lewis, argue that it is a matter of one and the same object having different <em>temporal parts</em> with incompatible properties; exdurantists (also known as stage theorists), like Sider, argue that it is a matter of different <em>temporal counterparts</em> having incompatible properties; while endurantists, like Haslanger, argue (roughly) that it is a matter of one and the same object having incompatible properties itself but at different <em>times</em>. <strong>H&amp;K</strong> contains many classic papers on the issues, usefully arranged into thematic groups. <strong>SH&amp;Z</strong> is also useful, containing a paper by Sider defending exdurantism and a paper by Hawthorne attacking the idea that the debate should be regarded as one about whether or not temporal parts (or counterparts) exist. See also Macbride (2001), arguing that the debate overlooks various alternative accounts of change; Koslicki (2003), on Sider’s argument from vagueness; and Magidor (2016), arguing that a host of argument offered in the literature are strictly orthogonal to the debate between endurantists and perdurantists. You might also want to think about overlap between this topic and <strong>OBJECTS</strong>. See, e.g., McGrath (2007) on the argument from coincidence or co-location. Lastly, you might want to think about some non-standard responses to the problem. Priest (2006) argues there are good reasons for thinking change produces <em>dialethias</em>, or true contradictions, while Hofweber (2009) and Einheuser (2012) argue there’s no real problem of change in the first place, only a <em>meta</em>-problem.</p>

<p>In getting a better grasp of this topic, I think it’s particularly helpful to understand how the notion of the <em>a priori</em> has figured in the history of philosophy. At the very least, you’ll want to look at Quine (1953). Though it doesn’t actually contain the expression “<em>a priori</em>”, it’s a renowned attack on what Bonjour calls moderate empiricism, and attempts to put a form of radical empiricism in its place. You’ll find good discussion of the issues in the first few chapters of Bonjour (1998), and a recent attempt to resuscitate moderate empiricism in the face of Quine’s attack in Boghossian (2003). In exploring contemporary work by other philosophers on the <em>a priori</em>, you should follow up the relevant references in Jenkins (2008). You’ll want to think, in the first place, about accounts of the <em>a priori</em> from the likes of Field and Peacocke, as well as Jenkins herself. Boghossian and Peacocke (2000) contains many key contributions to recent debate, including a paper by Kitcher reflecting on critical reaction to his (1980) paper. You’ll also want to think about Kripke, and alleged instances of contingent <em>a priori</em> truths. To that end, try Hawthorne (2002) and Chalmers (2008). (This is an issue that you’ll most likely encounter again if you do Philosophy of Mind, and certainly if you do Philosophical Logic.) Lastly, have a think a bit about whether the distinction between the <em>a priori</em> and the <em>a posteriori</em> is significant. Williamson (2013) is a recent paper arguing that it isn’t; Casullo (2015) is a response.</p>

<p>The literature for this topic is huge. For discussion of Mackie, see the first paper by Jaegwon Kim in <b>S&amp;T</b> and Scriven (2007). For discussion of Lewis, see the second paper by Kim in <b>S&amp;T</b>, as well as the papers by Horwich and Bennett. In order to overcome difficulties with his (1973) view, Lewis developed a different counterfactual theory, which is presented in his paper ‘Causation as Influence’ in Collins, Hall, and Paul, eds. (2004). Menzies (2001/14) provides a great overview of the issues surrounding these and other counterfactual approaches. You should also have a look at other approaches to causation. Perhaps the main one is the interventionist approach, a non-reductionist counterfactual approach that draws on the work of the computer scientist Judea Pearl. Woodward (2001/16) is a good introduction. If you’re interested in probablistic approaches, see in the first instance Hitchcock (1997/2018). Another approach worth looking at is the physical process acccount defended by Wesley Salmon. See his paper in <b>S&amp;T</b>, though the best introduction is his (2002). His view has fallen out of favour somewhat recently, however. Part of its appeal was the promise of an account of preemption cases, but on further examination, it’s not so clear. There’s some nice discussion in Hall (2009). The other pieces in <b>S&amp;T</b> are recommended; the editors’ introduction and the papers by Davidson and Tooley are all essential reading. See also the debate between Carroll and Schaffer in <b>SH&amp;Z</b> over whether or not there’s anything more to causal necessity than mere regularity. Lastly, try Psillos (2003) for a good overview of the issues. It’s too advanced to count as introductory, but provides detailed discussion of the Core Reading and other important approaches, including interventionism.</p>

Another thing to think about is time travel. Is it possible? Does it pose a problem for particular views about time? Lewis (1976) is a classic, arguing that it's possible. And see Vihvelin (1996) for discussion, and Wasserman (2017) for a recent book on the topic.

<p>In working further on this topic, you could do worse than work through the chapters of Part 2 of Berto and Plebani (2015), looking more closely at individual papers defending the views they discuss. Try the paper by Kris McDaniels in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009) for an example of the Ontological Pluralism discussed in Ch. 4, and Linnebo (2012) for an example of Neo-Fregeanism. For the Neo-Carnapianism discussed in Ch. 5, try Hirsch (2002), Thomas Hofweber’s paper in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), and Thomasson (2008). Fictionalism, discussed in Ch. 8 of Berto and Plebani (2015), is defended by Stephen Yablo in the piece above. For Meinongianism, discussed in Ch. 7, start with Reicher (2006/19). Fine (2012) is an example of the Grounding Approach discussed in Ch. 8. You’ll find other various useful papers in Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman, eds. (2009), along with a handy editors’ introduction. Two other recommendations: Lewis and Lewis (1970), a dialogue between two philosophers discussing whether there are holes, is a must-read, while Effingham (2013) is a fantastic introductory book, aimed at undergraduates and discussing issues of meta-ontology in relation to debates in specific areas of metaphysics. It can be profitably read in working further not just on meta-ontology, but also on topics such as <a href="#possible_worlds"><strong>POSSIBLE WORLDS</strong></a>, <a href="#time"><strong>TIME</strong></a>, and <a href="#persistence"><strong>PERSISTENCE</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In thinking more about what Crane and French are calling the problem of perception—the problem, roughly speaking, of explaining how our common-sense conception of perception can be sustained in light of the existence of illusions and hallucinations—follow up their references, making sure to think about the main pros and cons of sense-datum theories, adverbialism, intentionalism, and naive realism. You’ll find many of the key readings in Noë and Thompson, eds. (2002) and in Byrne and Logue, eds. (2009), and introductory discussion of the main positions in Fish (2010). Soteriou (2016)—focused on naive realism and other forms of disjunctivism but discussing sense-datum and intentional theories along the way—is a bit more advanced, but strongly recommended. See also Nudds (2009), a useful survey of recent critical work on naive realism. You also ought to think a bit about certain other debates in the philosophy of perception. For discussion of how perception gives us knowledge or justified belief about the world, see Lyons (2016) and the entries for <strong>SCEPTICISM</strong> and for <a href="#agrippa"><strong>AGRIPPA’S TRILEMMA</strong></a>. For discussion of issues concerning the so-called contents of perception, see Siegel (2005/16). For discussion of so-called <em>causal theories</em> of perception, see the papers by Grice, Lewis, and Snowdon in Noë and Thompson, eds. (2002) and Ch. 7 of Fish (2010).</p>

<p>Note that Raymond Martin and John Barresi, eds. (2003) <em>Personal Identity</em> (Blackwell), besides Olson’s paper, also contains the papers by Williams and Parfit, a helpful editors’ introduction, and various other important papers on this topic. I refer to it below as <strong>M&amp;B</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="past-paper-questions-25">PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</h4>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in more depth, Locke’s discussion in his <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (Bk II, Ch. 27) is essential reading, as are the famous replies from Thomas Reid and Joseph Butler. These are usefully collected, along with various other pieces, in Perry, ed. (2008). You’ll also want to think a bit about Williams. For some discussion, see the piece by Nozick in <strong>M&amp;B</strong>, Noonan (1982), and John Perry’s piece ‘Williams on The Self and the Future’ in Perry, ed. (2008). Otherwise, you should focus on Parfit and animalism. <strong>M&amp;B</strong> contains a number of pieces discussing Parfit: those by Lewis, Korsgaard, Unger, Sosa, Martin, Schechtman, and Johnston, as well as Parfit’s own ‘The Unimportance of Identity’. Lewis’s response is particularly important, and will seem less <em>ad hoc</em> if you’ve encountered his views on persistence more generally. For discussion of animalism, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Snowdon (1990) is an important statement and defence of the position. For other discussions, see Olson (2004), Shoemaker (2008), Madden (2011), and the collection, Blatti and Snowdon, eds. (2016)—the last containing a piece by Parfit arguing against animalism. For a recent book on personal identity, aimed at undergraduates, try Kind (2015).</p>
