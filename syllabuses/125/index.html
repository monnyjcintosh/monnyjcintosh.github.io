<h1 id="philosophy-of-cognitive-science">Philosophy of Cognitive Science</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Cognitive Science. Many of the readings are online, and all can be obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/125_Philosophy_of_Cognitive_Science_Jan11.pdf">Faculty Reading list</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the following <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. We begin by looking at meta-theoretical issues raised by two classics of cognitive science, Chomsky’s work in linguistics and Marr’s work on vision. We then consider the relationship between explanation in the cognitive sciences and our ordinary, person-level explanations of others’ behaviour and capacities. These first three weeks provide some theoretical background to the next two topics, the classical computational theory of mind, as it is articulated by one of its leading proponents, Jerry Fodor, and one of the main alternatives to it, connectionism. We then look at some potential limitations both of the computational theory and of cognitive science more generally, while the topic of the last week is left open, giving you scope to pursue your own areas of interest. Options here include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. (I’ve also listed some <strong>SPECIAL TOPICS</strong>, which some students have wanted to explore in the past. These are less likely to come up in exams, and some presuppose familiarity with other topics, but will help to deepen your understanding.)</p>

<p>The current version of this reading list was put together in light of my experience using previous incarnations in teaching Philosophy of Cognitive Science to undergraduates in Oxford over the years. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of this reading list at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Chomsky’s work in linguistics was a major part of the cognitive revolution of the 1950s. Chomsky (1965) presents some of his main conceptual innovations, including the notion of tacit knowledge. George (1986) is a short, and extremely useful discussion of the Quine-Chomsky debate. Evans’ dispositional approach was developed by Martin Davies and Christopher Peacocke, and criticised by Crispin Wright. For references and discussion, see their contributions to George (1989). (The contributions from George and Putnam are also relevant to this week’s topic.) Miller (1997) is a useful review of the debate, and there is some critical discussion of the dispositional approach in Collins (2004), who argues Chomsky’s notion of tacit knowledge is not epistemological in any substantive sense.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Peacocke (1986) argues for the need for a fourth level, intermediate between Marr’s computational and algorithmic-representational levels. See also the commentaries on this, and Peacocke’s replies, in <em>Mind &amp; Language</em> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14680017/1/4">Volume 1, Issue 4</a>. Sterelny (1990) is introductory, discussing problems in determining the algorithmic-representational level and the distinction between psychology and neuroscience. For more on the latter issue, see Gold and Stoljar (1999), which is published alongside various peer commentaries, and Feest (2003). Bechtel and Shagrir (2015), part of a special issue of <em>Topics in Cognitive Science</em> marking the 30th anniversary of Marr’s <em>Vision</em>, defends the importance of Marr’s three levels to understanding information-processing devices.</p>

<strong>OR</strong><br />
(b) Which of Marr’s three levels are most important for cognitive psychology? (2016)</p>

<p>In what sense, if any, can we study the mind/brain independently at each of Marr’s three levels of analysis and in what sense, if any, do the three levels constrain each other? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) ‘Each of the three levels of description will have its place in the eventual understanding of perceptual information processing, and of course they are logically and causally related.’ (MARR) ‘In Marr’s view, a higher level was independent of the levels below it.’ (CHURCHLAND &amp; SEJNOWSKI) Explain and discuss.<br />

Stich (1978) draws attention to another useful distinction in thinking about cognitive science, discussed by Drayson, between beliefs and what he calls <em>subdoxastic</em> states.

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Aydede (1998/2010), an introductory overview of the LOTH, its relation to the CTM, and arguments for and against it, is a good first port of call for further work on this issue. The LOTH is typically advanced as an empirical thesis, but Rey (1995) offers a more or less <em>a priori</em> line of argument. Laurence and Margolis (1997) examine regress arguments against the LOTH (though be warned that their take on Fodor is a bit misleading). Camp (2007) argues against the claim that thought must be language-like. This is a particularly helpful piece if you want to get clearer on the relationship between the CTM and the LOTH. Matthews (2007) argues against the RTM/CTM more generally.</p>

Part II of the collection contains classic papers addressing the question whether connectionism undermines folk psychology, another issue to explore.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Matthews (1997) argues that neither connectionists nor classicists have an explanation of systematicity, but that there are grounds for optimism about the prospects for a connectionist account. Johnson (2004) argues that thought is not systematic, properly understood, so there is nothing here for the connectionist to explain anyway.

Fodor (1983) is the book in which he first introduced his views on modularity, and is essential reading for this topic. Part III argues input systems are modular. Part IV argues central systems are not, and so are computationally intractable. Chapters 2 and 3 of Fodor (2000), listed above, update the case for thinking that central systems are computationally intractable. For replies, see Ludwig and Schneider (2008) and Fuller and Samuels (2014). Shea (2014) looks at the distinction between top-down and bottom-up effects, often invoked in discussions of modularity.

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
The use of double dissociations in theorising about cognition goes back to the 19th century, and Paul Broca, who identified a region of the brain employed in language processing, though the term <em>double dissociation</em> was first introduced by Hans-Lukas Tueber (1955). Coltheart (1999) is a short, clear statement of one of the key components of his ultra-cognitivist approach, the idea that the mind is composed of a system of domain-specific modules. Juola and Plunkett (2000) is an influential criticism of double dissociation methodology. McGeer (2007) argues on both empirical and philosophical grounds that the ultra-cognitivist approach is fundamentally misguided. Van Orden et al. (2010) argue that double dissociation of reading modules illustrates general problems with the ultra-cognitivists’ assumption of modularity.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
How strong is the case for a multi-factor account of Capgras delusion? (2017)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) Evaluate the case for single-factor and multi-factor accounts of delusional
thinking.<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
(b) To what extent are delusions like Capgras’ explicable by primary delusional experience? (2016)</p>

<p>Does making sense of delusions require us to postulate abnormalities in how beliefs are formed and maintained or does it suffice to appeal to abnormalities in perception or experience? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong><br />
(a) Is it plausible that a single explanatory framework could account for the wide
variety of delusions?<br />
<strong>OR</strong> <br />
(b) Critically discuss the following claim: ‘What we normally describe as the delusional belief that P ought sometimes to be described as the delusional belief that I believe that P.’ (CURRIE) (2014)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong>
(a) Are there good reasons for thinking that delusions are so irrational that they could
not be a type of belief? If they are not beliefs, what are they?
<strong>OR</strong>
(b) ‘The precipitating event is a perceptual impairment causing loss of normal affective reactions to the visual world, including such highly significant social stimuli as people’s faces.’ (STONE and YOUNG) If this were true, would it be sufficient to explain the Capgras delusion? (2013)</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
The rest of Sterelny and Griffiths (1999) provides an excellent introduction to the background issues in the philosophy of biology, and is well worth reading. It is useful too to get a sense of alternative accounts of the Wason card selection test, starting with Sperber et al. (1995). (Although sceptical of Cosmides and Tooby’s account of the test, Sperber himself is quite sympathetic to evolutionary psychology, and is a proponent of the Massive Modularity Hypothesis, readings for which are suggested below.) Lloyd (1999) argues that Cosmides and Tooby’s claims rest on a faulty understanding of evolutionary biology. Dupré (2012) takes a similar line. Cosmides and Tooby (2013) is a more recent summary of their work. Downes (2018) is a useful survey piece.</p>

Barrett and Kurzban (2006) is a useful review of arguments for and against massive modularity. (They are proponents.) Peter Carruthers defends massive modularity at length in his (2006) book. Wilson (2008) is a contribution to a symposium on this published by <em>Mind &amp; Language</em>. Among other things, Wilson discusses the so-called argument from animals. Rabaglia et al. (2011) present a challenge for massive modularity based on the so-called <em>positive manifold</em>, the fact that individuals who are high scoring in one cognitive domain tend to be high scoring on other cognitive domains. This suggests that high-level cognitive capacties are subserved by a single domain-general mechanism, rather than a range of domain-specific ones, as proponents of massive modularity claim. Robbins (2013) reviews the empirical evidence for massive modularity, and finds it wanting.</p>
