<h1 id="philosophy-of-cognitive-science">Philosophy of Cognitive Science</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Cognitive Science. Many of the readings are online, and all can be obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything. </p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/125_Philosophy_of_Cognitive_Science_Jan11.pdf">Faculty Reading list</a>.  </p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the following <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. Only the first six weeks are fixed, leaving us two weeks to pursue topics of your choosing. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>.  </p>

George (1986) is a short, useful clarification of what’s at stake between Quine and Chomsky. Davies (1987) defends and elaborates Evans’ attempt to meet Quine’s challenge. George (1989) is an edited volume. The contributions from George, Peacocke, and Davies are all relevant. Collins (2007) argues that linguistic competence should not be understood in terms of knowledge, tacit or otherwise, at all. </p>

<strong>OR</strong>
(b) Is the notion of ‘tacit knowledge’ trivial or can an appeal to tacit knowledge in the cognitive sciences help explain certain phenomena? (2014)</p>

<p>Is there any evidence to indicate that ordinary subjects have tacit knowledge of the grammatical rules of their language rather than merely behaving in conformity to those rules? (2013)</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Peacocke (1986) argues for the need for a fourth level of explanation, intermediate between Marr’s computational and algorithmic levels. Feest (2003) discusses the relation between multiple realizability and the autonomy of psychological explanation. Bechtel and Wright (2009) consider the extent to which the mechanistic perspective provides a unified account of psychological explanation. Weiskopf (2011) defends the view that psychological explanation need not be mechanistic.</p>

<strong>OR</strong> (b) Which of Marr’s three levels are most important for cognitive psychology? (2016)</p>

<p>In what sense, if any, can we study the mind/brain independently at each of Marr’s three levels of analysis and in what sense, if any, do the three levels constrain each other? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) ‘Each of the three levels of description will have its place in the eventual understanding of perceptual information processing, and of course they are logically and causally related.’ (MARR) ‘In Marr’s view, a higher level was independent of the levels below it.’ (CHURCHLAND &amp; SEJNOWSKI) Explain and discuss.

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the Language of Thought Hypothesis (LOTH)? How, if at all, does it differ from the Representational Theory of Mind (RTM) and the Computational Theory of Mind (CTM)? What are the best arguments for and against the LOTH? Are any of these arguments compelling?</p>

Block (1995) is an introductory piece, bringing together a number of the themes that we’ve been looking at over the past few weeks. §3 discusses the LOTH. Rey (1997) is aimed at upper undergraduates, and discusses a range of arguments for and against the CTM and LOTH. Laurence and Margolis (1997) address the objection that the LOTH involves a vicious regress. Matthews (2007) argues against the RTM/CTM more generally, which he calls the Received View.</p>

<h2 id="connectionism">4. CONNECTIONISM</h2>
<p><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
‘Connectionist models of cognitive processes are either unable to account for the systematicity of cognitive processes or are merely implementations of classical architectures. Either way, it follows that the mind cannot be a connectionist network.’ Explain and assess this objection.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Calvo and Symons (2014) is a recent edited volume devoted to the systematicity challenge. See in particular the essays in Part I. Churchland (1998) concerns a different issue, defending an account of content in connectionist networks based on similarities and differences between activation patterns. Fodor and Lepore (1999) is a reply. Garson (1997/2015) is an introductory survey of these and other issues raised by connectionism.</p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
What empirical content is there to the claim that thought is productive and systematic? Would the truth of the claim teach us anything about cognitive architecture? (2016)</p>

<p>‘Both [computationalism and connectionism] assume that the mind is basically a cognitive engine and only secondarily a seat of emotion, feeling, and sensation.’ (CUMMINS) Is this true? If so, is it a fundamental problem for such theories? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) What advantages, if any, do connectionist models of cognition have over classical computational models?
<strong>OR</strong> (b) Can connectionism explain the productivity and systematicity of thought without appealing to syntactically structured representations? (2014)</p>

<p>Connectionist models aim to do away with the idea that mental processing is rule-governed. What is the alternative conception of mental processing that connectionists rely on? How could this conception explain processes like reading words aloud or inferential reasoning that seem to be guided by rules? (2013)</p>

Fuller and Samuels (2014) is focused on Fodor’s claim that scientific inference is holistic. Jenkin and Siegel (2015) is a short survey of work on an issue relevant to Fodor’s claim that input systems are modular, whether perception is cognitively penetrable.</p>

<p>Explain what it means to say that belief fixation is isotropic and Quinean. Do these properties mean that we cannot fully explain how we come to form beliefs about the world? (2014)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong>
(a) Critically assess Fodor’s First Law of the Nonexistence of Cognitive Science: ‘The more global (e.g. the more isotropic) a cognitive process is, the less anybody understands it. Very global processes, like analogical reasoning, aren’t understood at all.’ (FODOR)
<strong>OR</strong>

Bortoletti (2012) defends the doxastic view (i.e. that delusions are beliefs). Matthews (2013) argues against it. See the Faculty reading list for suggestions on the issue of how delusions develop and persist, including debates over so-called <em>two factor</em> theories.  </p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
<strong>EITHER</strong> (a) Evaluate the case for single-factor and multi-factor accounts of delusional
thinking.
<strong>OR</strong> (b) To what extent are delusions like Capgras’ explicable by primary delusional experience? (2016)</p>

<p>Does making sense of delusions require us to postulate abnormalities in how beliefs are formed and maintained or does it suffice to appeal to abnormalities in perception or experience? (2015)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) Is it plausible that a single explanatory framework could account for the wide
variety of delusions?
<strong>OR</strong> (b) Critically discuss the following claim: ‘What we normally describe as the delusional belief that P ought sometimes to be described as the delusional belief that I believe that P.’ (CURRIE) (2014)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong>
(a) Are there good reasons for thinking that delusions are so irrational that they could
not be a type of belief? If they are not beliefs, what are they?
<strong>OR</strong>
(b) ‘The precipitating event is a perceptual impairment causing loss of normal affective reactions to the visual world, including such highly significant social stimuli as people’s faces.’ (STONE and YOUNG) If this were true, would it be sufficient to explain the Capgras delusion? (2013)</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
Explain and assess the claim that an explanation of a person’s behaviour and capacities can be <em>subpersonal</em>. What is the relation between such an explanation and our ordinary, <em>personal</em> explanations of such behaviour and capacities?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Stich (1978) draws attention to another useful distinction in thinking about cognitive science, discussed by Drayson, between beliefs and what he calls <em>subdoxastic</em> states. For Dennett’s later views, discussed by Hornsby, see, in the first instance, his (1981). Davies (2000) is another discussion of the personal/subpersonal distinction, and Bennett and Hacker (2003) a recent example of the objection to which Dennett was responding in the first place.</p>
