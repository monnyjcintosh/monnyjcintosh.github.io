<h1 id="philosophy-of-logic-and-language">Philosophy of Logic and Language</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Philosophy of Logic and Language. Many of the readings are online, and easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything.</p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/108%20Philosophy%20of%20Logic%20and%20Language.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>.</p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>. The first two weeks look at classic works by Frege and Russell, laying the foundations for the next three weeks, looking at some influential work from the 1970s by Kripke and Putnam on meaning and reference and Kaplan on indexicals. The next week looks at Davidson’s attempt to explicate meaning in terms of truth, while the last two weeks have been open for topics of your choosing. (I’m also happy to cover other topics in place of some of those suggested for the first six weeks, but if you want to do this, discuss it with me asap, preferably before the beginning of term.) Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>. (I’ve also listed some <strong>SPECIAL TOPICS</strong>, which some students have wanted to explore in the past. These are less likely to come up in exams, and some presuppose familiarity with other topics, but will help to deepen your understanding.)</p>

<p>I’ve had advice from various friends and colleagues in putting together this reading list and its previous incarnations, and am particularly grateful to Nick Tasker. If you’re teaching a similar course, and want to make use of this reading list at all, as occasional emails suggest people sometimes do, please feel free. I’d love to hear how it goes!</p>

<h4 id="essay-question">ESSAY QUESTION</h4>

<p>Why did Frege distinguish between sense and reference? Was he right to do so? If so, what is the sense of a proper name, such as ‘Hesperus’? If not, how is the informativeness of an identity statements, such as ‘Hesperus is Phosphorus’, to be explained?</p>

<h4 id="further-reading">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>Other relevant writings by Frege include his (1918) paper, which is well worth reading in connection with <a href="#indexicals"><strong>INDEXICALS and DEMONSTRATIVES</strong></a> as well. Contemporary scholarship on Frege is dominated by Michael Dummett’s work, especially his magisterial (1981). Chapter 5 discusses the sense-reference distinction. Burge’s writings on Frege, collected in his (2005), are no less essential, and probably more sensitive to textual and historical considerations. Part II focuses on sense and cognitive value, though the best place to start is ‘Frege on Truth’, first published in 1986, in Part I. Michael Kremer’s contribution to the same volume as Taschek’s, above, is also very helpful, as are Heck and May (2008) and the rest of Textor (2011). McDowell (1977) is another piece of essential reading, articulating a non-descriptive Fregean approach, but it is quite hard going; it will be easier to understand the main idea after you’ve done <a href="#davidson"><strong>TRUTH and MEANING</strong></a>. You might also want to look at the (tendentious) interpretation of Frege in Ch. 1 of Evans (1982), which offers a similar approach to McDowell’s. For more on the debate between Millians (or neo-Russellians) and Fregeans, see Caplan (2007) and Fodor (2008). For an introduction to <em>relationism</em>, an alternative approach developed by Kit Fine, see Gray (2017).</p>

<p>Do names have sense (Sinn) as well as reference (Bedeutung)? (2016, Paper 117)</p>

<p>To what extent do Frege’s reasons for ascribing sense and reference to proper names generalize to ascribing sense and reference to sentences? (2015, Paper 117)</p>

<p>‘Whilst it is plausible to suppose that words have a reference, and sentences a sense, it is not nearly so plausible to suppose that words have a sense and sentences a reference.’ Discuss, with reference to ONE or MORE of Frege, Russell, and the Tractatus. (2014, Paper 117)</p>

<p>How can the claim that Barcan is Marcus be informative? (2013, Paper 108)</p>

<p>(I’ve included questions from <em>Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein</em> (Paper 117), which has been discontinued. As I understand it, questions on Frege’s and Russell’s work in the philosophy of logic and language will from now on be set for <em>Philosophy of Logic and Language</em> instead.)</p>

<p>What is Russell’s theory of definite descriptions, and how does he try to motivate it? What are Strawson’s objections to Russell’s theory? Are they compelling, and what alternative account does he have to offer in its place? What are the implications of Donnellan’s distinction between <em>attributive</em> and <em>referential</em> uses of definite descriptions for Russell’s and Strawson’s theory?</p>

<p>Kripke (1977) is a must-read, defending Russell in response to the problems raised by Donnellan. Neale (1990) is an influential exposition and defence of Kripke’s position. See also Recanati (1993), offering a <em>contextualist</em> account of Donnellan’s examples, and Michael Devitt’s contribution to Reimer and Bezuidenhout, eds. (2004), offering an <em>ambiguity</em> account. See also Zacharska (2010), criticising the ambiguity account, and defending the contextualist one. While Russell’s position was for a long time the orthodox position—thanks in large part to Neale (1990)—Strawson’s has made a come back in recent years. Kai von Fintel’s paper in Reimer and Bezuidenhout, eds. (2004) is important here. See also Yablo (2006) and Elbourne (2013). (Paul Elbourne is often an examiner for this paper, so it may be a good idea to gain some familiarity with his views!)

<h4 id="further-reading-2">FURTHER READING</h4>

<p>In thinking about Kripke’s work on names in more depth, start with Soames (2002), which criticises the two main responses to the modal argument—the <em>wide scope</em> strategy, associated with Michael Dummett, and the <em>actualised description</em> strategy, associated with the likes of John Searle and (as you’ll see from next week’s Core Reading) Frank Jackson. Then look at Sosa (2002), which responds in defence of the wide scope strategy. For critical discussion of the epistemological argument, try Jeshion (2002). See also Graff Fara (2015), defending <em>predicativism</em>, the view (first defended by Tyler Burge) that names are predicates. For more on empty names, start with the criticism of Kripke’s approach in Ch. 10 of Evans (1982), listed in last week’s Further Reading. (Be warned: after criticising Kripke, Evans goes on to present a view that suffers from the same problem.) See also Braun (2005), a defence of Millianism, usefully contrasting his approach with that of other Millians, including Kripke, Amie Thomasson, and Nathan Salmon. And see Sainsbury (2010), a must read if you’re thinking about this week’s issues. Ch. 1 is a great, concise overview of some of the main positions on names, and Ch. 2 and 3 develop a non-descriptivist Fregeanism about empty names, employing a negative free logic. Think also a bit about the metasemantic question, what determines or fixes the reference of a name? Evans (1973) is a classic discussion of the so-called <em>causal theory</em> of reference, tentatively suggested by Kripke. See §3 of Speaks (2010/19) for an overview of the broader issues, some of which we’ll be exploring in weeks to come. For an overview of work on names, see Cumming (2008/19).</p>

<p>If you’re working on this topic in any depth, Pessin and Goldberg, eds. (1996) is extremely useful. The papers of most immediate relevance are those in Part II, focused on natural kinds and the philosophy of language—see especially the papers by Zemach, Mellor, and Searle. See also the papers by Burge in Part III, defending externalism about the contents of mental states, and Putnam’s introduction, which replies to Searle and Burge. Though it doesn’t tend to come up in exams, you might also want to think about Kripke’s approach to kind terms, rounding out your work on last week’s topic. See especially Lecture III of his <em>Naming and Necessity</em> and Ch. 9 to 11 of Soames (2002), listed, respectively, in the Core and Further Reading for <a href="#kripke"><strong>NAMING and NECESSITY</strong></a>. You’ll often find reference to the Kripke-Putnam account of kind terms, and there are certainly some commonalities, but don’t let such talk obscure the important differences between them in both theory and motivation. Hacking (2007) is excellent on this. See also Wikforss (2007), which carefully disentangles various externalist theses at work in debates, and distinguishes Putnam’s claims from those of both Kripke and Burge. For some recent and sympathetic discussion of Chomsky, see Pietroski (2017). For discussion of Jackson, see Ch. 4 of Kallestrup (2012), which also discusses the two-dimensionalist approach of Chalmers (2002). Segal (2004) offers an internalist account of natural kind concepts, and disputes the relevance of intuitions cited in support of externalism. Lastly, see Yli-Vakurri (2018) for a recent attempt to establish semantic externalism without thought experiments, and Sawyer (2018) for a reply.</p>

<p>The puzzle of invariant meaning goes back to Frege. See Perry (1977) on Frege’s treatment of the puzzle, arguing that it is inconsistent with certain aspects of his views about sense, and Evans (1985) for a reply.<!--See also Kripke (2011) on this, and Burge (2012), 'Living Wages of Sinn'. --> Kaplan’s solution to the puzzle emerged in the early 1970s out of earlier work by Richard Montague and the formal semantics tradition. He expands on his approach in his (1989b). For an alternative approach, emerging around about the same time out of the Davidsonian tradition that we look at in connection with <a href="#davidson"><strong>TRUTH and MEANING</strong></a>, see Burge (1974). You’re probably best to focus on the various problems that have been raised with Kaplan’s theory though. Cohen and Michaelson (2013) is an accessible survey piece on the so-called <em>answering machine paradox</em>, threatening Kaplan’s claim that ‘I am here now’ is a logical truth. Reimer (1991) and Bach (1992) debate the role of speakers’ intentions in determining the reference of a demonstrative. For further discussion of King’s approach to complex demonstratives, see his (2008) and the replies from Braun and Salmon in the same issue. <!--For alternatives to both Kaplan's and King's approaches, see Elbourne (2008) and Roberts (2002). -->You may also want to look at the Special Topic, <a href="#assertoric_content"><strong>ASSERTORIC CONTENT and INGREDIENT SENSE</strong></a>, especially the papers by Lewis and King, which discuss Kaplan’s identification of the contents of sentences with what they are used to say. Braun (2001/15) is a survey article on these and other issues surrounding Kaplan’s theory and indexicals and demonstratives more generally.</p>

<p>Make sure you have a good grasp of Foster’s problem and of the various solutions that have been offered for it. Segal (1999) gives a very nice, concise explanation of the issue before going on to present a solution, though the main approaches to think about are probably those of John McDowell and Jim Higginbotham. McDowell’s is found in his (1977) paper, listed under <a href="#frege"><strong>SENSE and REFERENCE</strong></a>. Platts (1997) and Wiggins (1997) are very helpful guides, not just to McDowell, but also to the Davidsonian program more generally. Higginbotham’s approach is set out in his (1992). For critical discussion of this, see Soames (2008), to which Lepore and Ludwig (2010) respond. General problems with explaining meaning in terms of truth include the worry, raised early on by Dummett in his (1959), that it is incompatible with deflationism about truth. Other problems, arguably more concerning details of implementation, concern the treatment of non-declarative sentences, whose meanings aren’t obviously amenable to explanation in terms of truth-conditions, and context-sensitivity. There’s some discussion of the first issue in McDowell (1977) and you can think about the second in connection with both <a href="#indexicals"><strong>INDEXICALS and DEMONSTRATIVES</strong></a> and <a href="#context-sensitivity"><strong>CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY</strong></a>. You’ll also find discussions of these and many other issues in Lepore and Ludwig (2005) and (2007); Ch. 5 of the former discusses context-sensitivity, and Ch. 12 of the latter non-declaratives. Davidson’s work is important if you’re thinking about metasemantics and large-scale issues first broached in connection with <a href="#kripke"><strong>NAMING and NECESSITY</strong></a>. See the other papers in his (2001) collection, above, particularly ‘Radical Interpretation’.</p>

<p>Neale (1992) is a sympathetic survey of Grice’s work. The first half focuses on his theory of conversation. Carston (2002) presents a relevance-theoretic case for (among other things) jettisoning the category of conventional implicature. Potts (2007) makes the case for keeping it. Lepore and Stone (2015) is a recent book, boldly arguing that “we have no use for a category of conversational implicatures, as traditionally and currently understood” (p. 6). Much of the debate lately focuses on scalar implicatures and embedded clauses. See, for example, Chierchia (2004) and Simon (2017).

Travis (1991) and Neale (1992) are two contrasting surveys of Grice's work. Broadly speaking, Travis is critical and Neale sympathetic. Conventional implicatures have long been viewed with suspicion. Carston (2002) (among other things) presents a relevance-theoretic case against them. Christopher Potts argues that they are needed. See his (2007), which condenses themes from his earlier book. Horn (2012) is a survey piece, written by a leading neo-Gricean. Lepore and Stone (2015) is a recent book, boldly arguing that "we have no use for a category of conversational implicatures, as traditionally and currently understood" (p. 6).

<p>Sainsbury (2009) is a great introduction to the issues. Soames (1999) is a sympathetic account of Kripke’s approach. Burge (1979) offers a contextualist solution which is interestingly different to that of Parsons (1974). Parsons (1990) is critical of dialetheism. Eklund (2002) defends the (Tarskian) idea that natural languages are inconsistent.</p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is the relationship between the <em>ingredient sense</em> of a sentence, i.e. the contribution that it makes to the truth-conditions of sentences in which it occurs, and its <em>assertoric content</em>, i.e. what it can be used on its own to say or assert?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Dummett first discussed the relationship between ingredient sense and assertoric content explicitly in his (1973) book, <em>Frege: Philosophy of Language</em>, though the roots go back to his (1959) article, ‘Truth’. His (2004) is a concise, and fairly accessible discussion. Glanzberg (2011) is a nice, short piece on the issues surrounding the semantics of tense. Ninan (2012) is a response to King. Mackay (2013) argues for “monsters”, or context-shifting operators. Stojnic (2017) is a nice recent paper on the topic, critically discussing an appeal Jason Stanley makes to the assertoric content-ingredient sense distinction.</p>
