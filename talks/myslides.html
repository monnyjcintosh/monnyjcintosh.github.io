<h2><!-- --></h2>
<p>Tim Williamson (1996, 2000) has famously proposed that knowledge is the norm of assertion.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Julian Schlöder (2018) examines the proposal within the context of deontic logic.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Schlöder argues for two claims about how Williamson’s proposal is to be formalised.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>On the basis of these, he goes on to raise a series of problems for the proposal itself.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>I’ll argue: Schlöder’s claims about how Williamson’s proposal is to be formalised can and <em>should</em> be rejected.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Why care about this?</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>It tells us something interesting about:</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<ol type="1">
<li>Whether Williamson’s proposal is defensible</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>How similar proposals about norms of assertion are best understood</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>How to use deontic logic to understand normative issues generally</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The structure of the talk: two parts, each focusing on one of Schlöder’s claims.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>First, a claim concerning the formalisation of the thesis that knowledge is <em>a</em> norm of assertion.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Second, a claim concerning the formalisation of the thesis that <em>nothing else</em> is a norm of assertion.</p>
</section></section>
<section><section id="the-first-claim" class="title-slide slide level1"><h1>THE FIRST CLAIM</h1></section><section id="section-1" class="slide level2">
<h2><!-- --></h2>
<p>Schlöder’s first claim concerns the formalisation of the thesis that knowledge is <em>a</em> norm of assertion.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Williamson formulates this as the claim that one must: assert that φ only if one knows that φ.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The obvious way of formalisation of this is:</p>
<p><strong>(KNA-W)</strong>: ◻(Aφ → Kφ)</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Schlöder claims it should instead be formalised as:</p>
<p><strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong>: ♢Aφ → Kφ</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>This translates to claim that, if it is permissible for one to assert that φ then one knows that φ.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Why does Schlöder prefer <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong>?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Williamson’s <em>How do you know that?</em> argument:</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>The thesis that knowledge is a norm of assertion explains why, if a speaker asserts something, we can ask her <em>how</em> she knows it.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Williamson’s <em>You don’t know that!</em> argument:</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>The thesis that knowledge is a norm of assertion explains why, if she doesn’t know it, she can be criticised for not knowing it.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Schlöder rightly insists that a formalisation of the thesis that knowledge is a norm of assertion should “sanction” these arguments.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Yet, he argues, while the relevant facts can be explained in terms of <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong>, they cannot be explained in terms of <strong>(KNA-W)</strong>.</p>
</section><section id="why-kna-nec-can-be-rejected" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why (KNA-Nec) can be rejected</h2>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>But the relevant facts <em>can</em> be explained in terms of <strong>(KNA-W)</strong>.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Suppose that a speaker asserts that P, i.e. that Ap holds.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Since the speaker either knows that P or does not know that P, it follows that…</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>(Ap &amp; Kp) ∨ (Ap &amp; ~Kp)</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>In other words, either (1) the speaker asserts that P and knows that P or (2) she asserts that P and does not know that P.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Suppose also that <strong>(KNA-W)</strong> holds.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Since ◻(Ap → Kp) is equivalent to ~♢(Ap &amp; ~Kp)…</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>if the speaker does not know that P, we’re in case (2), and the speaker has done something impermissible.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Contraposing: if the speaker has <em>not</em> done something impermissible, she <em>does</em> know that P.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So if knowledge is a norm of assertion, and this is formalised by <strong>(KNA-W)</strong>, then…</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>knowing that φ is necessary for doing something permissible in asserting that φ.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Given this, and two further, very plausible assumptions, the relevant facts follow.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>(α): where having property π is necessary for doing something permissible in ψ-ing, an agent who ψs may always be asked how she came to have property π.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Given that knowing something is necessary for doing something permissible in asserting it, it follows that a speaker who asserts something may always be asked how she knows it.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p><em>How do you know that?</em></p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>(β): where having property π is necessary for doing something permissible in ψ-ing, an agent who ψs and yet lacks property π may always be criticised for that lack.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Given that knowing something is necessary for doing something permissible in asserting it, it follows that a speaker who asserts something but does not know it can be criticised for not knowing it.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p><em>You don’t know that!</em></p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So <strong>(KNA-W)</strong> does “sanction” Williamson’s arguments for the knowledge norm.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>For all Schlöder has shown, then, <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> can be rejected.</p>
<p>Moreover: it <em>should</em> be rejected.</p>
<!---

I'll make two criticisms. In presenting the second, I'll explain why I think Schlöder failed to see that **(KNA-W)** can enable explanations of the *How do you know that?* and *You don’t know that!* arguments. -->
</section><section id="why-kna-nec-should-be-rejected" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why (KNA-Nec) should be rejected</h2>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>First: <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> is too weak to fully capture the thesis that knowledge is a norm of assertion.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Any adequate formalisation of that thesis should entail that it is not permissible to assert something that one does not know, i.e. ~♢(Aφ &amp; ~Kφ).</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Since ~♢(Aφ &amp; ~Kφ) is equivalent to ◻(Aφ → Kφ), my favoured formalisation, <strong>(KNA-W)</strong>, does this easily.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>But <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> doesn’t. In a standard deontic logic, KD4, it is consistent with ♢(Ap &amp; ~Kp).</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>This can be fixed by strengthening the logic. (In particular, by requiring the accessibility relation to be step reflexive.)</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So though I think this is a significant problem with <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong>, I don’t think it’s decisive.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The main problem: <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> is too strong to capture the thesis that knowledge is a norm of assertion.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Why? <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> is equivalent to, and so entails,</p>
<p>~Kφ → ~♢Aφ.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>This formalises the claim that, if one does not know something, it is not permissible for one to assert it.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>But what’s wrong with that? If knowledge is a norm of assertion, and one doesn’t know that P, then the assertion one makes is impermissible.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Doesn’t this mean an adequate formalisation of the thesis that knowledge is a norm of assertion <em>should</em> entail ~Kφ → ~♢Aφ?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Tentative suggestion: Schlöder thinks so, and this is the root of his objection to <strong>(KNA-W)</strong>.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>He thinks: if a speaker asserts that P but doesn’t know that P (and knowledge is a norm of assertion,) that assertion is impermissible.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>He also thinks: we cannot capture the fact that her assertion is impermissible unless our formalisation somehow entails ~♢Ap.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>I think this reasoning trades on a confusion between something like type and token.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>I agree that the speaker’s assertion that P is impermissible. But I don’t think that asserting that P is impermissible.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The speaker’s assertion is of the type: asserting that P. But that’s not what makes it impermissible.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>It <em>can’t</em> be: she might go on to find out that P, and (for all the knowledge norm requires) perfectly permissibly assert that P.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>What makes the speaker’s assertion impermissible is rather that it is of the type: asserting that P and not knowing that P.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>To best bring out the point, think about a particular example model-theoretically.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Suppose that I assert that it’s raining, but I don’t know whether it is. And suppose we want to build a model representing my current situation and practical options.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>If knowledge is a norm of assertion, my assertion is impermissible. We thus represent my current situation as a world w where Ap and ~Kp both hold, but which is not accessible from itself.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So ~Kp holds at w, and there is at least <em>one</em> world where Ap holds that is not accessible from w: w itself.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>But <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> amounts to the much stronger claim that <em>all</em> worlds where Ap holds are not accessible from w.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>And this is just too strong. Among my practical options, let’s suppose, is that of going to the window, discovering that it’s raining, and asserting as much.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>If that <em>is</em> one of my practical options, we want to represent it by including a possible world w’ at which Ap and Kp both hold <em>which is accessible from w</em>.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>But we can only do this if we reject <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong>, and allow that worlds in which Ap holds may be accessible from worlds in which ~Kp holds.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>In short, an adequate formalisation of the thesis that knowledge is a norm of assertion ought <em>not</em> to entail ~Kφ → ~♢Aφ.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Since it <em>does</em> entail ~Kφ → ~♢Aφ, <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> is too strong.</p>
</section></section>
<section><section id="the-second-claim" class="title-slide slide level1"><h1>THE SECOND CLAIM</h1></section><section id="section-2" class="slide level2">
<h2><!-- --></h2>
<p>Schlöder’s first claim concerned the thesis that knowledge is <em>a</em> norm of assertion.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The second claim concerns the thesis that nothing <em>else</em> is a norm of assertion.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>He points out that <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> and Kp, Ap, and ~♢Ap are jointly consistent (in standard deontic logic).</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So, he concludes, if we are to formalise the thesis that knowledge is <em>the</em> norm of assertion, <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> needs supplementation with…</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p><strong>(KNA-Suff)</strong>: Kφ → ♢Aφ</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>This formalises the claim that if one knows something, it is permissible to assert it.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Kp, Ap, and ~♢Ap are jointly consistent with <strong>(KNA-W)</strong> in standard deontic logic too.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So if Schlöder’s right to conclude that <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> needs supplementation, so too does <strong>(KNA-W)</strong>.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>But what’s the problem, exactly? Why does its consistency with Kp, Ap, and ~♢Ap show <strong>(KNA-W)</strong> needs supplementing?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Schlöder’s central thought:</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>If an assertion conforms to the knowledge norm and yet is impermissible, the assertion must violate some other norm of assertion: “knowledge would at most be a <em>partial</em> norm of assertion,” Schlöder writes, “but not <em>the</em> norm” (p. 3).</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So a formalisation of the thesis that knowledge is <em>the</em> norm of assertion is adequate only if…</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>…it implies that it is not possible for an assertion to conform to the knowledge norm and nevertheless be impermissible.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The fact that Kp, Ap, and ~♢Ap are jointly consistent with <strong>(KNA-W)</strong> shows that it doesn’t meet this adequacy condition.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>It allows for the possibility of assertions that conform to the knowledge norm (Ap and Kp) and yet are impermissible (since ~♢Ap).</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>But Schlöder’s central thought is simply false:</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>An assertion may conform to the knowledge norm and nevertheless be impermissible, not because it violates some other norm of assertion, but because it violates some non-assertoric norm, i.e. a norm, such as a norm of politeness, that is not a norm of assertion.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Schlöder tries to abstract away from non-assertoric norms by reading the permissibility operator, ♢, in a particular way.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The idea: it may be permissible in the intended sense to assert something, even though it is not permissible in a broader sense.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Specifically, he suggests we read ♢ as “one is in a position to”.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>But this doesn’t address the problem.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>First, someone who knows that P, but who is obliged not to reveal that P, having been told that P in confidence, is <em>not</em> in a position to assert that P…</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>…even though doing so would not violate the knowledge norm or, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, any other norm of assertion.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Second, and more importantly, even if the abstraction worked, it’s irrelevant.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The issue is simply: if knowledge is the norm of assertion, can an assertion conform to the norm and yet be impermissible?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The sense of the word ‘impermissible’ here is just the ordinary one.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>And the answer to the question is just “yes”, as examples of assertions that violate non-assertoric norms shows.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>This shows that <strong>(KNA-Suff)</strong> <em>can</em> be rejected. It also shows that it <em>should</em> be.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>If an assertion can conform to the knowledge norm and yet be impermissible because it violates some non-assertoric norm, instances of <strong>(KNA-Suff)</strong> may in fact be false.</p>
</section></section>
<section><section id="conclusion" class="title-slide slide level1"><h1>CONCLUSION</h1></section><section id="section-3" class="slide level2">
<h2><!-- --></h2>
<p>Schlöder claims that the thesis that knowledge is <em>a</em> norm of assertion should be formalised as <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong>.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>This claim <em>can</em> be rejected: the obvious formalisation, <strong>(KNA-W)</strong>, is unproblematic.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>It also <em>should</em> be rejected: <strong>(KNA-Nec)</strong> is both too weak and, crucially, too strong.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Schlöder also claims that the thesis that knowledge is <em>the</em> norm of assertion requires us to supplement <strong>(KNA-W)</strong> with <strong>(KNA-Suff)</strong>.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>This claim also can and should be rejected: it wrongly rules out the possibility of assertions that conform to the knowledge norm but violate other, non-assertoric norms.</p>
