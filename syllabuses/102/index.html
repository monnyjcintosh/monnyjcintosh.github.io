<h1 id="knowledge--reality">Knowledge &amp; Reality</h1>

<p>Below are readings and essay questions for tutorials in Knowledge &amp; Reality. Many of the readings are available online, and all are easily obtained from the college or other libraries in Oxford, but if you are struggling to get hold of anything, email me, as I have PDF copies of <em>nearly</em> everything. </p>

<p>I have divided the reading for each topic into <strong>CORE READING</strong> and <strong>FURTHER READING</strong>, with more introductory texts marked with a star (*). Focus on the Core Reading suggestions in writing tutorial essays, and use the Further Reading suggestions as starting points for exploring topics in more depth during vacations. You will find more suggestions in the <a href="https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/91a74877-2e21-45ab-9134-ed8846aec33a/Reading%20Lists/FHS/102%20Knowledge%20and%20Reality%20Nov%2009.pdf">Faculty Reading List</a>. </p>

<p>The default plan is to cover the <strong>TUTORIAL TOPICS</strong>, but I am happy to cover other topics in place of some of these. Options include, but are not limited to, the <strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong>.</p>

Weatherson (2003) is an interesting defence of the JTB analysis of knowledge. Greenough and Pritchard (2009) is a collection of papers on Williamson’s epistemology. For helpful discussion of his arguments against analysis and his positive proposal that knowledge is the most general factive state, see the papers by Quassim Cassam and Elizabeth Fricker, as well as Williamson’s replies. The Gettier problem has received a great deal of attention from so-called experimental philosophers. See Nagel (2012) for discussion and criticism of this. Hyman (2014) is a short piece arguing against Williamson’s claim that knowledge is the most general factive stative attitude.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
DeRose (2009) is an up-to-date statement and defence of contextualism. Brown (2006) defends an orthodox invariantist position, opposed both to contextualism and the subject-sensitive invariantism (SSI) endorsed by the likes of Hawthorne and Stanley. The debate between contextualism and SSI raises questions about the role of pragmatic elements in knowledge. Fantl and McGrath (2009) is a great discussion of this. Conee and Cohen (2014) is a useful debate for and against contextualism. It includes, among other things, discussion of whether contextualism provides a satisfactory response to scepticism. </p>

<p><strong>ESSAY QUESTION</strong><br />
What is <em>a priori</em> knowledge? Do we have any? If so, how is it possible for us to have it? In particular, can the possibility of <em>a priori</em> knowledge be explained in terms of analyticity?</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
The rest of Bonjour (1998) is very useful, particularly the first three chapters. Kripke (1980) famously argues against identifying <em>a priori</em> knowability with necessity, arguing that there are both <em>a posteriori</em> necessities and <em>a priori</em> contingencies. The relevant selections are reprinted in Paul Moser, ed. (1987) <em>A Priori Knowledge</em> (OUP), as is Quine (1951) and a number of other classic papers on this topic. Boghossian (1997) is an interesting and influential attempt to resuscitate an account of the <em>a priori</em> in terms of analyticity. Williamson (2011) argues that the <em>a priori</em>/<em>a posteriori</em> distinction is of “little theoretical significance”. Bonjour and Devitt (2014) debate whether anything is knowable <em>a priori</em>.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
If you plan on looking into this topic in any more detail, the first three chapters of David Lewis’s (1986) book are essential reading. The first lays out a case for his brand of modal realism, the second defends it from various objections, and the third presents objections to various rival views. Bricker and Melia (2008) is a recent debate; they defend concretism and ersatzism respectively. The remaining suggestions all discuss other approaches. Rosen (1990) defends a fictionalist approach. Melia (1992) argues against modalism, the view (roughly) that modal notions are primitive, and not to be explicated in terms of possible worlds. Fine (1994) argues that modal notions are to be explicated in terms of objects’ essences. </p>

Fine (2006) is difficult but rewards the effort, arguing for the reality of tense. Lewis (1976) is a defence of the possibility of backwards time travel. </p>

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Zimmerman (1998) defends a presentist solution to the problem of temporary intrinsics. Hawthorne (2008) is a very useful discussion, distinguishing the question of whether objects <em>have</em> temporal parts with different properties from the question of whether objects change over time <em>because</em> they have temporal parts with different properties, opening up the prospect of a four-dimensionalist endurantism. Magidor (2016) argues most of the arguments offered for endurantism and perdurantism “crucially rely on theses which are strictly orthogonal to the [debate]”. Thomson (1983) and Olson (2006) discuss another puzzle related to persistence over time: the issue of how objects can gain or lose parts over time. </p>

<p><strong>PAST PAPER QUESTIONS</strong><br />
‘The following two claims are in tension: (1) There can be change over time; (2) At least some non-essential properties of objects are intrinsic.’ Explain how this tension might most plausibly be thought to arise. How would you propose to resolve it? (2016)</p>

<p><strong>EITHER</strong> (a) ‘Consider a headless statue called “HEADLESS”. Suppose that at some later time T HEADLESS has been augmented by attaching a head to it. Call the whole statue after this augmentation “HEADY”. Consider the portion of HEADY consisting of the whole statue except for its head, and call that object “HEADY-MINUS”. On the one hand, we should say that HEADLESS has gained a head and is thus identical to HEADY. On the other hand, we should say that HEADLESS is identical to HEADY- MINUS. But these statements cannot both be true.’ How should this quandary be resolved? <strong>OR</strong> (b) Are there any good reasons to prefer the view that objects persist by perduring rather than by enduring?

<p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong><br />
Quine’s paper is the first salvo in a famous debate with Carnap. Carnap (1950) was the response, which in turn prompted Quine’s famous ‘Two Dogmas of Empiricism’. Quine was long regarded as having won the day, but the issue is now seen as less clear cut, owing at least in part to Yablo (1998), which discusses the debate and defends Carnap. Van Inwagen (1998) is a clear statement and defence of the Quinean position. Berto and Plebani’s (2015) book is an accessible overview of work on this topic, defending the Quinean position - which they call the Standard View.</p>

Forbes (1985) argues that unless things have non-trivial individual essences, transworld identities will be problematically ungrounded. Mackie (2006) discusses Forbes. Lewis (1986) discusses his counterpart theory in more detail. Fara and Williamson (2005) argues against it. (Be warned: this paper is quite technical.) </p>

<!--
Fine (1994) discusses something related to issues of transworld identity, arguing that facts about an object's essential properties cannot be understood in terms of facts about its modal properties (such as its having that property in every possible world), but rather vice-versa: facts abouts its modal properties have to be understood in terms of its essential properties.-->
